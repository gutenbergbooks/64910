EDITION</h2>
</div>


<p>In the reprintings of a book of this character
it would be possible to revise and rewrite in
such manner as to conceal the errors or misjudgments
of the author. It seems, however,
more honest to permit these impressions to
stand practically as they were written, with only
a few minor corrections. It was my aim to
make note of conditions, tendencies, and needs
in the Valley of Democracy, and the conclusion
of the war has affected my point of view with
reference to these matters very little.</p>

<p>The first months of the present year have been
so crowded with incidents affecting the whole
world that we recall with difficulty the events
of only a few years ago. We have met repeated
crises with an inspiring exhibition of unity and
courage that should hearten us for the new tasks
of readjustment that press for attention, and for
the problems of self-government that are without
end. I shall feel that these pages possess
some degree of vitality if they quicken in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
mind and heart of the reader a hope and confidence
that we of America do not walk blindly,
but follow a star that sheds upon us a perpetual
light.</p>

<p>France evoked from the unknown the valley that may, in more than
one sense, be called the heart of America.... The chief significance
and import of the addition of this valley to the maps of the world, all
indeed that makes it significant, is that here was given (though not of
deliberate intent) a rich, wide, untouched field, distant, accessible only
to the hardiest, without a shadowing tradition or a restraining fence, in
which men of all races were to make attempt to live together under
rules of their own devising and enforcing. And as here the government
of the people by the people was to have even more literal interpretation
than in that Atlantic strip which had traditions of property suffrage
and church privilege and class distinctions, I have called it the &#8220;Valley
of the New Democracy.&#8221;</p>

THE FOLKS AND THEIR FOLKSINESS</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THE great trouble with these fellows
down here,&#8221; remarked my friend as
we left the office of a New York
banker&mdash;&#8220;the trouble with all of &#8217;em is that
they forget about the <i>Folks</i>. You noticed that
when he asked in his large, patronizing way
how things are going out West he didn&#8217;t wait
for us to answer; he pressed a button and told
his secretary to bring in those tables of railroad
earnings and to-day&#8217;s crop bulletins and that
sort of rubbish, so he could tell <i>us</i>. It never
occurs to &#8217;em that the Folks are human beings
and not just a column of statistics. Why, the
<i>Folks</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>My friend, an orator of distinction, formerly
represented a tall-corn district in Congress. He
drew me into Trinity churchyard and discoursed
in a vein with which I had long been
familiar upon a certain condescension in Easterners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
and the East&#8217;s intolerable ignorance of
the ways and manners, the hopes and aims, of
the West, which move him to rage and despair.
I was aware that he was gratified to have an
opportunity to unbosom himself at the brazen
gates of Wall Street, and equally conscious that
he was experimenting upon me with phrases
that he was coining for use on the hustings.
They were so used, not without effect, in the
campaign of 1916&mdash;a contest whose results were
well calculated to draw attention to the &#8220;Folks&#8221;
as an upstanding, independent body of citizens.</p>

<p>Folks is recognized by the lexicographers as
an American colloquialism, a variant of folk.
And folk, in old times, was used to signify the
commonalty, the plain people. But my friend,
as he rolled &#8220;Folks&#8221; under his tongue there in
the shadow of Trinity, used it in a sense that
excluded the hurrying midday Broadway throng
and restricted its application to an infinitely
superior breed of humanity, to be found on
farms, in villages and cities remote from tide-water.
His passion for democracy, his devotion
to the commonweal, is not wasted upon New
Englanders or Middle States people. In the
South there are Folks, yes; his own people had
come out of North Carolina, lingered a while in
Kentucky, and lodged finally in Indiana, whence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
following a common law of dispersion, they
sought new homes in Illinois and Kansas. Beyond
the Rockies there are Folks; he meets
their leaders in national conventions; but they
are only second cousins of those valiant freemen
who rallied to the call of Lincoln and followed
Grant and Sherman into battles that shook the
continent. My friend&#8217;s point of view is held by
great numbers of people in that region we now
call the Middle West. This attitude or state of
mind with regard to the East is not to be taken
too seriously; it is a part of the national humor,
and has been expressed with delightful vivacity
and candor in Mr. William Allen White&#8217;s refreshing
essay, &#8220;Emporia and New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>A definition of Folks as used all the way from
Ohio to Colorado, and with particular point and
pith by the haughty sons and daughters of Indiana
and Kansas, may be set down thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Folks.</span> <i>n.</i> A superior people, derived largely from
the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic races and domiciled in those
northern States of the American Union whose waters fall
into the Mississippi. Their <i>folksiness</i> (<i>q. v.</i>) is expressed
in sturdy independence, hostility to capitalistic influence,
and a proneness to social and political experiment. They
are strong in the fundamental virtues, more or less sincerely
averse to conventionality, and believe themselves
possessed of a breadth of vision and a devotion to the
common good at once beneficent and unique in the annals
of mankind.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>We of the West do not believe&mdash;not really&mdash;that
we are the only true interpreters of the
dream of democracy. It pleases us to swagger
a little when we speak of ourselves as the Folks
and hint at the dire punishments we hold in
store for monopoly and privilege; but we are
far less dangerous than an outsider, bewildered
or annoyed by our apparent bitterness, may be
led to believe. In our hearts we do not think
ourselves the only good Americans. We merely
feel that the East began patronizing us and that
anything we may do in that line has been forced
upon us by years of outrageous contumely.
And when New York went to bed on the night
of election day, 1916, confident that as went
the Empire State so went the Union, it was only
that we of the West might chortle the next
morning to find that Ah Sin had forty packs
concealed in his sleeve and spread them out on
the Sierra Nevadas with an air that was child-like
and bland.</p>

<p>Under all its jauntiness and cocksureness,
the West is extremely sensitive to criticism. It
likes admiration, and expects the Eastern visitor
to be properly impressed by its achievements,
its prodigious energy, its interpretation and
practical application of democracy, and the
earnestness with which it interests itself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
things of the spirit. Above all else it does not
like to appear absurd. According to its light it
intends to do the right thing, but it yields to
laughter much more quickly than abuse if the
means to that end are challenged.</p>

<p>The pioneers of the older States endured hardships
quite as great as the Middle Westerners;
they have contributed as generously to the national
life in war and peace; the East&#8217;s aid to
the West, in innumerable ways, is immeasurable.
I am not thinking of farm mortgages, but
of nobler things&mdash;of men and women who carried
ideals of life and conduct, of justice and
law, into new territory where such matters were
often lightly valued. The prowler in these
Western States recognizes constantly the trail
of New Englanders who founded towns, built
schools, colleges, and churches, and left an ineffaceable
stamp upon communities. Many of
us Westerners sincerely admire the East and do
reverence to Eastern gods when we can sneak
unobserved into the temples. We dispose of
our crops and merchandise as quickly as possible,
that we may be seen of men in New York.
Western school-teachers pour into New England
every summer on pious pilgrimages to Concord
and Lexington. And yet we feel ourselves, the
great body of us, a peculiar people. &#8220;Ten days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
of New York, and it&#8217;s me for my home town&#8221;
in Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, or Colorado. This
expresses a very general feeling in the provinces.</p>

<p>It is far from my purpose to make out a case
for the West as the true home of the Folks in
these newer connotations of that noun, but
rather to record some of the phenomena observable
in those commonwealths where we are
assured the Folks maintain the only true ark
of the covenant of democracy. Certain concessions
may be assumed in the unconvinced
spectator whose path lies in less-favored portions
of the nation. The West does indubitably
coax an enormous treasure out of its soil to be
tossed into the national hopper, and it does exert
a profound influence upon the national life; but
its manner of thought is different: it arrives at
conclusions by processes that strike the Eastern
mind as illogical and often as absurd or dangerous.
The two great mountain ranges are barriers
that shut it in a good deal by itself in spite
of every facility of communication; it is disposed
to be scornful of the world&#8217;s experience
where the experience is not a part of its own
history. It believes that forty years of Illinois
or Wisconsin are better than a cycle of Cathay,
and it is prepared to prove it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_006.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Ten days of New York, and it&#8217;s me for my home town.&#8221;</p>

<p>The West&#8217;s philosophy is a compound of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Franklin and Emerson, with a dash of Whitman.
Even Washington is a pale figure behind
the Lincoln of its own prairies. Its curiosity is
insatiable; its mind is speculative; it has a supreme
confidence that upon an agreed state of
facts the Folks, sitting as a high court, will hand
down to the nation a true and just decision upon
any matter in controversy. It is a patient listener.
Seemingly tolerant of false prophets, it
amiably gives them hearing in thousands of
forums while awaiting an opportunity to smother
their ambitions on election day. It will not, if
it knows itself, do anything supremely foolish.
Flirting with Greenbackism and Free Silver, it
encourages the assiduous wooers shamelessly and
then calmly sends them about their business.
Maine can approach her election booths as coyly
as Ohio or Nebraska, and yet the younger States
rejoice in the knowledge that after all nothing is
decided until they have been heard from. Politics
becomes, therefore, not merely a matter for
concern when some great contest is forward,
but the year round it crowds business hard for
first place in public affection.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The people of the Valley of Democracy (I am
indebted for this phrase to Dr. John H. Finley)
do a great deal of thinking and talking; they
brood over the world&#8217;s affairs with a peculiar
intensity; and, beyond question, they exchange
opinions with a greater freedom than their fellow
citizens in other parts of America. I have
travelled between Boston and New York on
many occasions and have covered most of New
England in railway journeys without ever being
addressed by a stranger; but seemingly in the
West men travel merely to cultivate the art of
conversation. The gentleman who borrows your
newspaper returns it with a crisp comment on
the day&#8217;s events. He is from Beatrice, or Fort
Collins, perhaps, and you quickly find that he
lives next door to the only man you know in his
home town. You praise Nebraska, and he meets
you in a generous spirit of reciprocity and compliments
Iowa, Minnesota, or any other commonwealth
you may honor with your citizenship.</p>

<p>The West is proud of its talkers, and is at
pains to produce them for the edification of the
visitor. In Kansas a little while ago my host
summoned a friend of his from a town eighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
miles away that I might hear him talk. And it
was well worth my while to hear that gentleman
talk; he is the best talker I have ever
heard. He described for me great numbers of
politicians past and present, limning them with
the merciless stroke of a skilled caricaturist, or,
in a benignant mood, presented them in ineffaceable
miniature. He knew Kansas as he
knew his own front yard. It was a delight to
listen to discourse so free, so graphic in its characterizations,
so colored and flavored with the
very soil. Without impropriety I may state
that this gentleman is Mr. Henry J. Allen, of
the Wichita <i>Beacon</i>; the friend who produced
him for my instruction and entertainment is
Mr. William Allen White of the Emporia
<i>Gazette</i>. Since this meeting I have heard Mr.
Allen talk on other occasions without any feeling
that I should modify my estimate of his
conversational powers. In his most satisfying
narrative, &#8220;The Martial Adventures of Henry
and Me,&#8221; Mr. White has told how he and
Mr. Allen, as agents of the Red Cross, bore the
good news of the patriotism and sympathy of
Kansas to England, France, and Italy, and certainly
America could have sent no more heartening
messengers to our allies.</p>

<p>I know of no Western town so small that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
doesn&#8217;t boast at least one wit or story-teller
who is exhibited as a special mark of honor for
the entertainment of guests. As often as not
these stars are women, who discuss public matters
with understanding and brilliancy. The
old superstition that women are deficient in
humor never struck me as applicable to American
women anywhere; certainly it is not true of
Western women. In a region where story-telling
flourishes, I can match the best male anecdotalist
with a woman who can evoke mirth by
neater and defter means.</p>

<p>The Western State is not only a political but
a social unit. It is like a club, where every one
is presumably acquainted with every one else.
The railroads and interurbans carry an enormous
number of passengers who are solely upon
pleasure bent. The observer is struck by the
general sociability, the astonishing amount of
visiting that is in progress. In smoking compartments
and in day coaches any one who is
at all folksy may hear talk that is likely to prove
informing and stimulating. And this cheeriness
and volubility of the people one meets greatly
enhances the pleasure of travel. Here one is reminded
constantly of the provincial confidence
in the West&#8217;s greatness and wisdom in every
department of human endeavor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>In January of last year it was my privilege to
share with seven other passengers the smoking-room
of a train out of Denver for Kansas City.
The conversation was opened by a vigorous,
elderly gentleman who had, he casually remarked,
crossed Kansas six times in a wagon.
He was a native of Illinois, a graduate of Asbury
(Depauw) College, Indiana, a Civil War
veteran, and he had been a member of the Missouri
Legislature. He lived on a ranch in Colorado,
but owned a farm in Kansas and was
hastening thither to test his acres for oil. The
range of his adventures was amazing; his acquaintance
embraced men of all sorts and conditions,
including Buffalo Bill, whose funeral he
had just attended in Denver. He had known
General George A. Custer and gave us the true
story of the massacre of that hero and his command
on the Little Big Horn. He described
the &#8220;bad men&#8221; of the old days, many of whom
had honored him with their friendship. At least
three of the company had enjoyed like experiences
and verified or amplified his statements.
This gentleman remarked with undisguised satisfaction
that he had not been east of the Mississippi
for thirty years!</p>

<p>I fancied that he acquired merit with all the
trans-Mississippians present by this declaration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
However, a young commercial traveller who had
allowed it to become known that he lived in
New York seemed surprised, if not pained, by
the revelation. As we were passing from one
dry State to another we fell naturally into a discussion
of prohibition as a moral and economic
factor. The drummer testified to its beneficent
results in arid territory with which he was familiar;
one effect had been increased orders from
his Colorado customers. It was apparent that
his hearers listened with approval; they were
citizens of dry States and it tickled their sense
of their own rectitude that a pilgrim from the
remote East should speak favorably of their
handiwork. But the young gentleman, warmed
by the atmosphere of friendliness created by his
remarks, was guilty of a grave error of judgment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right for these Western towns,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but you could never put it over in New
York. New York will never stand for it. London,
Paris, New York&mdash;there&#8217;s only one New
York!&#8221;</p>

<p>The deep sigh with which he concluded, expressive
of the most intense loyalty, the most
poignant homesickness, and perhaps a thirst of
long accumulation, caused six cigars, firmly set
in six pairs of jaws, to point disdainfully at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
ceiling. No one spoke until the offender had
betaken himself humbly to bed. The silence
was eloquent of pity for one so abandoned.
That any one privileged to range the cities of the
West should, there at the edge of the great plain,
set New York apart for adoration, was too impious,
too monstrous, for verbal condemnation.</p>

<p>Young women seem everywhere to be in motion
in the West, going home from schools, colleges,
or the State universities for week-ends, or
attending social functions in neighboring towns.
Last fall I came down from Green Bay in a train
that was becalmed for several hours at Manitowoc.
I left the crowded day coach to explore
that pleasing haven and, returning, found that
my seat had been pre-empted by a very charming
young person who was reading my magazine
with the greatest absorption. We agreed that
the seat offered ample space for two and that
there was no reason in equity or morals why
she should not finish the story she had begun.
This done, she commented upon it frankly and
soundly and proceeded to a brisk discussion of
literature in general. Her range of reading had
been wide&mdash;indeed, I was embarrassed by its
extent and impressed by the shrewdness of her
literary appraisements. She was bound for a
normal school where she was receiving instruction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
not for the purpose of entering into the
pedagogical life immediately, but to obtain a
teacher&#8217;s license against a time when it might
become necessary for her to earn a livelihood.
Every girl, she believed, should fit herself for
some employment.</p>

<p>Manifestly she was not a person to ask favors
of destiny: at eighteen she had already made
terms with life and tossed the contract upon the
knees of the gods. The normal school did not
require her presence until the day after to-morrow,
and she was leaving the train at the end of
an hour to visit a friend who had arranged a
dance in her honor. If that species of entertainment
interested me, she said, I might stop
for the dance. Engagements farther down the
line precluded the possibility of my accepting
this invitation, which was extended with the utmost
circumspection, as though she were offering
an impersonal hospitality supported by the
sovereign dignity of the commonwealth of Wisconsin.
When the train slowed down at her
station a commotion on the platform announced
the presence of a reception committee of considerable
magnitude, from which I inferred that
her advent was an incident of importance to the
community. As she bade me good-by she tore
apart a bouquet of fall flowers she had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
carrying, handed me half of them, and passed
from my sight forever. My exalted opinion of
the young women of Wisconsin was strengthened
on another occasion by a chance meeting
with two graduates of the State University who
were my fellow voyagers on a steamer that
bumped into a riotous hurricane on its way
down Lake Michigan. On the slanting deck
they discoursed of political economy with a zest
and humor that greatly enlivened my respect
for the dismal science.</p>

<p>The listener in the West accumulates data
touching the tastes and ambitions of the people
of which local guide-books offer no hint. A little
while ago two ladies behind me in a Minneapolis
street-car discussed Cardinal Newman&#8217;s
&#8220;Dream of Gerontius,&#8221; with as much avidity as
though it were the newest novel. Having found
that the apostles of free verse had captured and
fortified Denver and Omaha, it was a relief to
encounter these Victorian pickets on the upper
waters of the Mississippi.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>One is struck by the remarkable individuality
of the States, towns, and cities of the West.
State boundaries are not merely a geographical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
expression: they mark real differences of opinion,
habit, custom, and taste. This is not a sentimental
idea; any one may prove it for himself
by crossing from Illinois into Wisconsin, or from
Iowa into Nebraska. Kansas and Nebraska,
though cut out of the same piece, not only seem
different but they <i>are</i> different. Interest in
local differentiations, in shadings of the &#8220;color&#8221;
derived from a common soil, keep the visitor
alert. To be sure the Ladies of the Lakes&mdash;Chicago,
Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Toledo,
Duluth&mdash;have physical aspects in common,
but the similarity ends there. The literature
of chambers of commerce as to the number
of freight-cars handled or increases of population
are of no assistance in a search for the
causes of diversities in aim, spirit, and achievement.</p>

<p>The alert young cities watch each other
enviously&mdash;they are enormously proud and
anxious not to be outbettered in the struggle for
perfection. In many places one is conscious of
an effective leadership, of a man or a group of
men and women who plant a target and rally
the citizenry to play for the bull&#8217;s-eye. A conspicuous
instance of successful individual leadership
is offered by Kansas City, where Mr. William
R. Nelson, backed by his admirable newspaper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
<i>The Star</i>, fought to the end of his life to
make his city a better place to live in. Mr.
Nelson was a remarkably independent and courageous
spirit, his journalistic ideals were the
highest, and he was deeply concerned for the
public welfare, not only in the more obvious
sense, but equally in bringing within the common
reach enlightening influences that are likely
to be neglected in new communities. Kansas
City not only profited by Mr. Nelson&#8217;s wisdom
and generosity in his lifetime, but the community
will receive ultimately his entire fortune. I
am precluded from citing in other cities men
still living who are distinguished by a like devotion
to public service, but I have chosen Mr.
Nelson as an eminent example of the force that
may be wielded by a single citizen.</p>

<p>Minneapolis offers a happy refutation of a
well-established notion that a second generation
is prone to show a weakened fibre. The sons
of the men who fashioned this vigorous city
have intelligently and generously supported
many undertakings of highest value. The Minneapolis
art museum and school and an orchestra
of widening reputation present eloquent testimony
to the city&#8217;s attitude toward those things
that are more excellent. Contrary to the usual
history, these were not won as the result of laborious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
effort but rose spontaneously. The public
library of this city not only serves the hurried
business man through a branch in the business
district, equipped with industrial and commercial
reference books, but keeps pace with the
local development in art and music by assembling
the best literature in these departments.
Both Minneapolis and Kansas City are well advertised
by their admirably managed, progressive
libraries. More may be learned from a
librarian as to the trend of thought in his community
than from the secretary of a commercial
body. It is significant that last year, when municipal
affairs were much to the fore in Kansas
City, there was a marked increase in the use of
books on civic and kindred questions. The latest
report of the librarian recites that &#8220;as the
library more nearly meets the wants of the community,
the proportion of fiction used grows
less, being but 34 per cent of the whole issue for
the year.&#8221; Similar impulses and achievements
are manifested in Cleveland, a city that has
written many instructive chapters in the history
of municipal government. Since her exposition
of 1904 and the splendid pageant of 1914 crystallized
public aspiration, St. Louis has experienced
a new birth of civic pride. Throughout
the West American art has found cordial support.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
In Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit, Cincinnati,
Indianapolis, St. Louis, Chicago, Minneapolis,
Omaha, and Kansas City there are noteworthy
specimens of the best work of American
painters. The art schools connected with the
Western museums have exercised a salutary influence
in encouraging local talent, not only in
landscape and portraiture, but in industrial designing.</p>

<p>By friendly co-operation on the part of
Chicago and St. Louis smaller cities are able
to enjoy advantages that would otherwise be
beyond their reach. Lectures, orchestras, and
travelling art exhibits that formerly stopped at
Chicago or jumped thence to California, now
find a hearty welcome in Kansas City, Omaha,
and Denver. Thus Indianapolis was among the
few cities that shared a few years ago in the
comprehensive presentation of Saint Gaudens&#8217;s
work. The expense of the undertaking was not
inconsiderable, but merchants and manufacturers
bought tickets for distribution among their
employees and met the demand with a generosity
that left a balance in the art association&#8217;s
treasury. These Western cities, with their political
and social problems, their rough edges,
smoke, and impudent intrusions of tracks and
chimneys due to rapid development and phenomenal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
prosperity, present art literally as the
handmaiden of industry&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;All-lovely Art, stern Labor&#8217;s fair-haired child.&#8221;</p>

<p>If any one thing is quite definitely settled
throughout this territory it is that yesterday&#8217;s
leaves have been plucked from the calendar:
this verily is the land of to-morrow. One does
not stand beside the Missouri at Omaha and
indulge long in meditations upon the turbulent
history and waywardness of that tawny stream;
the cattle receipts for the day may have broken
all records, but there are schools that must be
seen, a collection of pictures to visit, or lectures
to attend. I unhesitatingly pronounce Omaha
the lecture centre of the world&mdash;reception
committees flutter at the arrival of all trains.
Man does not live by bread alone&mdash;not
even in the heart of the corn belt in a city that
haughtily proclaims itself the largest primary
butter-market in the world! It is the great
concern of Kansas that it shall miss nothing;
to cross that commonwealth is to gain the impression
that politics and corn are hard pressed
as its main industries by the cultural mechanisms
that produce sweetness and light. Iowa
goes to bed early but not before it has read an
improving book!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Art exhibits ... now find a hearty welcome.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>In those Western States where women have
assumed the burden of citizenship they seem
to lose none of their zeal for art, literature, and
music. Equal suffrage was established in Colorado
in 1893, and the passing pilgrim cannot fail
to be struck by the lack of self-consciousness with
which the women of that State discuss social
and political questions. The Western woman is
animated by a divine energy and she is distinguished
by her willingness to render public
service. What man neglects or ignores she
cheerfully undertakes, and she has so cultivated
the gentle art of persuasion that the masculine
check-book opens readily to her demand
for assistance in her pet causes.</p>

<p>It must not be assumed that in this land of
pancakes and panaceas interest in &#8220;culture&#8221;
is new or that its manifestations are sporadic
or ill-directed. The early comers brought with
them sufficient cultivation to leaven the lump,
and the educational forces and cultural movements
now everywhere marked in Western
communities are but the fruition of the labors
of the pioneers who bore books of worth and
a love of learning with them into the wilderness.
Much sound reading was done in log cabins
when the school-teacher was still a rarity, and
amid the strenuous labors of the earliest days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
many sought self-expression in various kinds
of writing. Along the Ohio there were bards
in abundance, and a decade before the Civil
War Cincinnati had honest claims to being a
literary centre. The numerous poets of those
days&mdash;Coggeshall&#8217;s &#8220;Poets and Poetry of the
West,&#8221; published in 1866, mentions one hundred
and fifty-two!&mdash;were chiefly distinguished by
their indifference to the life that lay nearest
them. Sentiment and sentimentalism flourished
at a time when life was a hard business, though
Edward Eggleston is entitled to consideration
as an early realist, by reason of &#8220;The Hoosier
Schoolmaster,&#8221; which, in spite of Indiana&#8217;s
repudiation of it as false and defamatory, really
contains a true picture of conditions with which
Eggleston was thoroughly familiar. There followed
later E. W. Howe&#8217;s &#8220;The Story of a
Country Town&#8221; and Hamlin Garland&#8217;s &#8220;Main
Travelled Roads,&#8221; which are landmarks of
realism firmly planted in territory invaded later
by Romance, bearing the blithe flag of Zenda.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the Mississippi valley
should prove far more responsive to the chimes
of romance than to the harsh clang of realism.
The West in itself is a romance. Virginia&#8217;s
claims to recognition as the chief field of tourney
for romance in America totter before the history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of a vast area whose soberest chronicles
are enlivened by the most inthralling adventures
and a long succession of picturesque characters.
The French voyageur, on his way from
Canada by lake and river to clasp hands with
his kinsmen of the lower Mississippi; the American
pioneers, with their own heroes&mdash;George
Rogers Clark, &#8220;Mad Anthony&#8221; Wayne, and
&#8220;Tippecanoe&#8221; Harrison; the soldiers of Indian
wars and their sons who fought in Mexico in
the forties; the men who donned the blue in the
sixties; the Knights of the Golden Circle, who
kept the war governors anxious in the border
States&mdash;these are all disclosed upon a tapestry
crowded with romantic strife and stress.</p>

<p>The earliest pioneers, enjoying little intercourse
with their fellows, had time to fashion
many a tale of personal adventure against the
coming of a visitor, or for recital on court days,
at political meetings, or at the prolonged &#8220;camp
meetings,&#8221; where questions of religion were
debated. They cultivated unconsciously the
art of telling their stories well. The habit of
story-telling grew into a social accomplishment
and it was by a natural transition that here
and there some one began to set down his tales
on paper. Thus General Lew Wallace, who
lived in the day of great story-tellers, wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
&#8220;The Fair God,&#8221; a romance of the coming of
Cortez to Mexico, and followed it with &#8220;Ben
Hur,&#8221; one of the most popular romances ever
written. Crawfordsville, the Hoosier county-seat
where General Wallace lived, was once
visited and its romanticism menaced by Mr.
Howells, who sought local color for the court
scene in &#8220;A Modern Instance,&#8221; his novel of
divorce. Indiana was then a place where legal
separations were obtainable by convenient processes
relinquished later to Nevada.</p>

<p>Maurice Thompson and his brother Will,
who wrote &#8220;The High Tide at Gettysburg,&#8221;
sent out from Crawfordsville the poems and
sketches that made archery a popular amusement
in the seventies. The Thompsons, both
practising lawyers, employed their leisure in
writing and in hunting with the bow and arrow.
&#8220;The Witchery of Archery&#8221; and &#8220;Songs of
Fair Weather&#8221; still retain their pristine charm.
That two young men in an Indiana country
town should deliberately elect to live in the
days of the Plantagenets speaks for the romantic
atmosphere of the Hoosier commonwealth.
A few miles away James Whitcomb
Riley had already begun to experiment with a
lyre of a different sort, and quickly won for
himself a place in popular affection shared only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
among American poets by Longfellow. Almost
coincident with his passing rose Edgar Lee
Masters, with the &#8220;Spoon River Anthology,&#8221;
and Vachel Lindsay, a poet hardly less distinguished
for penetration and sincerity, to chant
of Illinois in the key of realism. John G. Niehardt
has answered their signals from Nebraska&#8217;s
corn lands. Nor shall I omit from the briefest
list the &#8220;Chicago Poems&#8221; of Carl Sandburg.
The &#8220;wind stacker&#8221; and the tractor are dangerous
engines for Romance to charge: I should
want Mr. Booth Tarkington to umpire so momentous
a contest. Mr. Tarkington flirts
shamelessly with realism and has shown in
&#8220;The Turmoil&#8221; that he can slip overalls and
jumper over the sword and ruffles of Beaucaire
and make himself a knight of industry. Likewise,
in Chicago, Mr. Henry B. Fuller has posted
the Chevalier Pensieri-Vani on the steps of the
board of trade, merely, we may assume, to
collect material for realistic fiction. The West
has proved that it is not afraid of its own shadow
in the adumbrations of Mrs. Mary A. Watts,
Mr. Robert Herrick, Miss Willa Sibert Cather,
Mr. William Allen White, and Mr. Brand Whitlock,
all novelists of insight, force, and authority;
nor may we forget that impressive tale of
Chicago, Frank Norris&#8217;s &#8220;The Pit,&#8221; a work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
that gains in dignity and significance with the
years.</p>

<p>Education in all the Western States has not
merely performed its traditional functions, but
has become a distinct social and economic force.
It is a far cry from the day of the three R&#8217;s and
the dictum that the State&#8217;s duty to the young
ends when it has eliminated them from the
illiteracy columns of the census to the State
universities and agricultural colleges, with their
broad curricula and extension courses, and the
free kindergartens, the manual-training high
schools, and vocational institutions that are socializing
and democratizing education.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In every town of the great Valley there are
groups of people earnestly engaged in determined
efforts to solve governmental problems.
These efforts frequently broaden into &#8220;movements&#8221;
that succeed. We witness here constant
battles for reform that are often won only
to be lost again. The bosses, driven out at
one point, immediately rally and fortify another.
Nothing, however, is pleasanter to
record than the fact that the war upon vicious
or stupid local government goes steadily on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
and that throughout the field under scrutiny
there have been within a decade marked and
encouraging gains. The many experiments
making with administrative devices are rapidly
developing a mass of valuable data. The very
lack of uniformity in these movements adds to
their interest; in countless communities the
attention is arrested by something well done
that invites emulation. Constant scandals in
municipal administration, due to incompetence,
waste, and graft, are slowly penetrating to the
consciousness of the apathetic citizen, and sentiment
favorable to the abandonment of the
old system of partisan local government has
grown with remarkable rapidity. The absolute
divorcement of municipalities from State and
national politics is essential to the conduct of
city government on business principles. This
statement is made with the more confidence
from the fact that it is reinforced by a creditable
literature on the subject, illustrated by countless
surveys of boss-ridden cities where there is
determined protest against government by the
unfit. That cities shall be conducted as stock
companies with reference solely to the rights
and needs of the citizen, without regard to
party politics, is the demand in so many quarters
that the next decade is bound to witness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
striking transformations in this field. Last
March Kansas City lost a splendidly conducted
fight for a new charter that embraced the city-manager
plan. Here, however, was a defeat
with honor, for the results proved so conclusively
the contention of the reformers, that the bosses
rule, that the effort was not wasted. In Chicago,
Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Minneapolis, the
leaven is at work, and the bosses with gratifying
density are aiding the cause by their hostility
and their constant illustration of the evils
of the antiquated system they foster.</p>

<p>The elimination of the saloon in States that
have already adopted prohibition promises political
changes of the utmost importance in municipal
affairs. The saloon is the most familiar
and the most mischievous of all the outposts
and rallying centres of political venality. Here
the political &#8220;organization&#8221; maintains its faithful
sentinels throughout the year; the good
citizen, intent upon his lawful business and
interested in politics only when election day
approaches, is usually unaware that hundreds of
barroom loafers are constantly plotting against
him. The mounting &#8220;dry wave&#8221; is attributable
quite as much to revolt against the saloon as
the most formidable of political units as to a
moral detestation of alcohol. Economic considerations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
also have entered very deeply into
the movement, and prohibition advocated as a
war measure developed still another phase.
The liquor interests provoked and invited the
drastic legislation that has overwhelmed their
traffic and made dry territory of a large area
of the West. By defying regulatory laws and
maintaining lobbies in legislatures, by cracking
the whip over candidates and office-holders,
they made of themselves an intolerable nuisance.
Indiana&#8217;s adoption of prohibition was
very largely due to antagonism aroused by the
liquor interests through their political activities
covering half a century. The frantic efforts of
breweries and distilleries there and in many
other States to persuade saloon-keepers to obey
the laws in the hope of spiking the guns of the
opposition came too late. The liquor interests
had counselled and encouraged lawlessness too
long and found the retailer spoiled by the immunity
their old political power had gained for
him.</p>

<p>A sweeping Federal law abolishing the traffic
may be enacted while these pages are on the
press.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Without such a measure wet and dry
forces will continue to battle; territory that is
only partly dry will continue its struggle for
bone-dry laws, and States that roped and tied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
John Barleycorn must resist attempts to put
him on his feet again. There is, however,
nothing to encourage the idea that the strongly
developed sentiment against the saloon will lose
its potency; and it is hardly conceivable that
any political party in a dry State will write a
wet plank into its platform, though stranger
things have happened. Men who, in Colorado
for example, were bitterly hostile to prohibition
confess that the results convince them of its
efficacy. The Indiana law became effective last
April, and in June the workhouse at Indianapolis
was closed permanently, for the interesting reason
that the number of police-court prisoners
was so reduced as to make the institution unnecessary.</p>

<p>The economic shock caused by the prostration
of this long-established business is absorbed
much more readily than might be imagined.
Compared with other forms of manufacturing,
brewing and distilling have been enormously
profitable, and the operators have usually taken
care of themselves in advance of the destruction
of their business. I passed a brewery near
Denver that had turned its attention to the
making of &#8220;near&#8221; beer and malted milk, and
employed a part of its labor otherwise in the
manufacture of pottery. The presence of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
herd of cows on the brewery property to supply
milk, for combination with malt, marked, with
what struck me as the pleasantest of ironies, a
cheerful acquiescence in the new order. Denver
property rented formerly to saloon-keepers
I found pretty generally occupied by shops of
other kinds. In one window was this alluring
sign:</p>

<p>The West&#8217;s general interest in public affairs is
not remarkable when we consider the history of
the Valley. The pioneers who crossed the Alleghanies
with rifle and axe were peculiarly jealous
of their rights and liberties. They viewed every
political measure in the light of its direct, concrete
bearing upon themselves. They risked
much to build homes and erect States in the
wilderness and they insisted, not unreasonably,
that the government should not forget them in
their exile. Poverty enforced a strict watch
upon public expenditures, and their personal
security entered largely into their attitude toward
the nation. Their own imperative needs,
the thinly distributed population, apprehensions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
created by the menace of Indians, stubbornly
hostile to the white man&#8217;s encroachments&mdash;all
contributed to a certain selfishness in the settlers&#8217;
point of view, and they welcomed political
leaders who advocated measures that promised
relief and protection. As they listened to the
pleas of candidates from the stump (a rostrum
fashioned by their own axes!) they were intensely
critical. Moreover, the candidate himself
was subjected to searching scrutiny. Government,
to these men of faith and hardihood,
was a very personal thing: the leaders they
chose to represent them were in the strictest
sense their representatives and agents, whom
they retired on very slight provocation.</p>

<p>The sharp projection of the extension of
slavery as an issue served to awaken and crystallize
national feeling. Education, internal
improvements to the accompaniment of wildcat
finance, reforms in State and county governments,
all yielded before the greater issue. The
promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
had led the venturous husbandmen into
woods and prairies, and they viewed with abhorrence
the idea that one man might own another
and enjoy the fruits of his labor. Lincoln
was not more the protagonist of a great cause
than the personal spokesman of a body of freemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
who were attracted to his standard by the
facts of his history that so largely paralleled
their own.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that Lincoln and
the struggle of which he was the leader roused
the Middle West to its first experience of a
national consciousness. The provincial spirit
vanished in an hour before the beat of drums
under the elms and maples of court-house yards.
The successful termination of the war left the
West the possessor of a new influence in national
affairs. It had not only thrown into the conflict
its full share of armed strength but had
sent Grant, Sherman, and many military stars
of lesser magnitude flashing into the firmament.
The West was thenceforth to be reckoned with
in all political speculations. Lincoln was the
precursor of a line of Presidents all of whom
were soldiers: Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Harrison,
McKinley; and there was no marked disturbance
in the old order until Mr. Cleveland&#8217;s advent in
1884, with a resulting flare of independence not
wholly revealed in the elections following his
three campaigns.</p>

<p>My concern here is not with partisan matters,
nor even with those internal upheavals that in
the past have caused so much heartache to the
shepherds of both of the major political flocks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
With only the greatest delicacy may one refer
to the Democratic schism of 1896 or to the
break in the Republican ranks of 1912. But
the purposes and aims of the Folks with respect
to government are of national importance.
The Folks are not at all disposed to relinquish
the power in national affairs which they have
wielded with growing effectiveness. No matter
whether they are right or wrong in their judgments,
they are far from being a negligible force,
and forecasters of nominees and policies for
the future do well to give heed to them.</p>

<p>The trend toward social democracy, with
its accompanying eagerness to experiment with
new devices for confiding to the people the power
of initiating legislation and expelling unsatisfactory
officials, paralleled by another tendency
toward the short ballot and the concentration
of power&mdash;these and kindred tendencies are
viewed best in a non-partisan spirit in those
free Western airs where the electorate is fickle,
coy, and hard to please. A good deal of what
was called populism twenty years ago, and associated
in the minds of the contumelious with
long hair and whiskers, was advocated in 1912
by gentlemen who called themselves Progressives
and were on good terms with the barber.
In the Progressive convention of 1916 I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
struck by the great number of Phi Beta Kappa
keys worn by delegates and sympathetic spectators.
If they were cranks they were educated
cranks, who could not be accused of ignorance
of the teachings of experience in their political
cogitations. They were presumably acquainted
with the history of republics from the beginning
of time, and the philosophy to be deduced
from their disasters. It was because the Progressive
party enlisted so many very capable
politicians familiar with organization methods
that it became a formidable rival of the old
parties in 1912. In 1916 it lost most of these
supporters, who saw hope of Republican success
and were anxious to ride on the band-wagon.
Nothing, however, could be more reassuring
than the confidence in the people, <i>i. e.</i>, the Folks
manifested by men and women who know their
Plato and are familiar with Isaiah&#8217;s distrust of
the crowd and his reliance upon the remnant.</p>

<p>The isolation of the independent who belongs
to no organization and is unaware of the
number of voters who share his sentiments,
militates against his effectiveness as a protesting
factor. He waits timidly in the dark for
a flash that will guide him toward some more
courageous brother. The American is the most
self-conscious being on earth and he is loath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to set himself apart to be pointed out as a crank,
for in partisan camps all recalcitrants are viewed
contemptuously as erratic and dangerous persons.
It has been demonstrated that a comparatively
small number of voters in half a
dozen Western States, acting together, can
throw a weight into the scale that will defeat
one or the other of the chief candidates for the
presidency. If they should content themselves
with an organization and, without nominating
candidates, menace either side that aroused
their hostility, their effectiveness would be increased.
But here again we encounter that
peculiarity of the American that he likes a crowd.
He is so used to the spectacular demonstrations
of great campaigns, and so enjoys the thunder
of the captains and the shouting, that he is
overcome by loneliness when he finds himself
at small conferences that plot the overthrow
of the party of his former allegiance.</p>

<p>The West may be likened to a naughty boy
in a hickory shirt and overalls who enjoys pulling
the chair from under his knickerbockered, Eton-collared
Eastern cousins. The West creates a
new issue whenever it pleases, and wearying of
one plaything cheerfully seeks another. It
accepts the defeat of free silver and turns joyfully
to prohibition, flattering itself that its chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
concern is with moral issues. It wants to make
the world a better place to live in and it believes
in abundant legislation to that end. It
experiments by States, points with pride to
the results, and seeks to confer the priceless
boon upon the nation. Much of its lawmaking
is shocking to Eastern conservatism, but no
inconsiderable number of Easterners hear the
window-smashing and are eager to try it at
home.</p>

<p>To spank the West and send it supperless
to bed is a very large order, but I have conversed
with gentlemen on the Eastern seaboard
who feel that this should be done. They go
the length of saying that if this chastisement is
neglected the republic will perish. Of course,
the West doesn&#8217;t want the republic to perish; it
honestly believes itself preordained of all time
to preserve the republic. It sits up o&#8217; nights
to consider ways and means of insuring its
preservation. It is very serious and doesn&#8217;t at
all like being chaffed about its hatred of Wall
Street and its anxiety to pin annoying tick-tacks
on the windows of ruthless corporations.
It is going to get everything for the Folks that
it can, and it sees nothing improper in the idea
of State-owned elevators or of fixing by law
the height of the heels on the slippers of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
emancipated women. It is in keeping with
the cheery contentment of the West that it
believes that it has &#8220;at home&#8221; or can summon
to its R. F. D. box everything essential to human
happiness.</p>

<p>Across this picture of ease, contentment, and
complacency fell the cloud of war. What I am
attempting is a record of transition, and I have
set down the foregoing with a consciousness
that our recent yesterdays already seem remote;
that many things that were true only a few
months ago are now less true, though it is none
the less important that we remember them. It
is my hope that what I shall say of that period
to which we are even now referring as &#8220;before
the war&#8221; may serve to emphasize the sharpness
of America&#8217;s new confrontations and the yielding,
for a time at least, of the pride of sectionalism
to the higher demands of nationality.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT the end of a week spent in a Middle
Western city a visitor from the East
inquired wearily: &#8220;Does no one work
in this town?&#8221; The answer to such a question
is that of course everybody works; the town
boasts no man of leisure; but on occasions the
citizens play, and the advent of any properly
certified guest affords a capital excuse for a
period of intensified sociability. &#8220;Welcome&#8221;
is writ large over the gates of all Western cities&mdash;literally
in letters of fire at railway-stations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Approaching a town the motorist finds himself
courteously welcomed and politely requested
to respect the local speed law, and as he departs
a sign at the postern thanks him and urges
his return. The Western town is distinguished
as much by its generous hospitality as by its enterprise,
its firm purpose to develop new territory
and widen its commercial influence. The
visitor is bewildered by the warmth with which
he is seized and scheduled for a round of exhausting
festivities. He may enjoy all the delights
that attend the triumphal tour of a d&eacute;butante
launched upon a round of visits to the
girls she knew in school or college; and he will
be conscious of a sincerity, a real pride and
joy in his presence, that warms his heart to
the community. Passing on from one town to
another, say from Cincinnati to Cleveland,
from Kansas City to Denver, from Omaha to
Minneapolis, he finds that news of his approach
has preceded him. The people he has met at
his last stopping-place have wired everybody
they know at the next point in his itinerary to
be on the lookout for him, and he finds that instead
of entering a strange port there are friends&mdash;veritable
friends&mdash;awaiting him. If by
chance he escapes the eye of the reception committee
and enters himself on the books of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
inn, he is interrupted in his unpacking by offers
of lodging in the homes of people he never saw
before.</p>

<p>There is no other region in America where
so much history has been crowded into so brief
a period, where young commonwealths so quickly
attained political power and influence as in the
Middle West; but the founding of States and
the establishment of law is hardly more interesting
than the transfer to the wilderness of
the dignities and amenities of life. From the
verandas of country clubs or handsome villas
scattered along the Great Lakes, one may almost
witness the receding pageant of discovery
and settlement. In Wisconsin and Michigan
the golfer in search of an elusive ball has been
known to stumble upon an arrow-head, a significant
reminder of the newness of the land;
and the motorist flying across Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois sees log cabins that survive from
the earliest days, many of them still occupied.</p>

<p>Present comfort and luxury are best viewed
against a background of pioneer life; at least
the sense of things hoped for and realized in
these plains is more impressive as one ponders
the self-sacrifice and heroism by which the soil
was conquered and peopled. The friendliness,
the eagerness to serve that are so charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and winning in the West date from those times
when one who was not a good neighbor was a
potential enemy. Social life was largely dependent
upon exigencies that brought the busy
pioneers together, to cut timber, build homes,
add a barn to meet growing needs, or to assist
in &#8220;breaking&#8221; new acres. The women, eagerly
seizing every opportunity to vary the monotony
of their lonely lives, gathered with the men,
and while the axes swung in the woodland
or the plough turned up the new soil, held a
quilting, spun flax, made clothing, or otherwise
assisted the hostess to get ahead with her never-ending
labors. To-day, throughout the broad
valley the grandchildren and great-grandchildren
of the pioneers ply the tennis-racket and
dance in country club-houses beside lakes and
rivers where their forebears drove the plough
or swung the axe all day, and rode miles to dance
on a puncheon floor. There was marrying and
giving in marriage; children were born and
&#8220;raised&#8221; amid conditions that cause one to
smile at the child-welfare and &#8220;better-baby&#8221;
societies of these times. The affections were
deepened by the close union of the family in the
intimate association of common tasks. Here,
indeed, was a practical application of the dictum
of one for all and all for one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>The lines of contact between isolated clearings
and meagre settlements were never wholly
broken. Months might pass without a household
seeing a strange face, but always some
one was on the way&mdash;an itinerant missionary,
a lost hunter, a pioneer looking for a new field
to conquer. Motoring at ease through the
country, one marvels at the journeys accomplished
when blazed trails were the only highways.
A pioneer railroad-builder once told
me of a pilgrimage he made on horseback from
northern Indiana to the Hermitage in Tennessee
to meet Old Hickory face to face. Jackson
had captivated his boyish fancy and this
arduous journey was a small price to pay for
the honor of viewing the hero on his own acres.
I may add that this gentleman achieved his
centennial, remaining a steadfast adherent of
Jacksonian democracy to the end of his life.
Once I accompanied him to the polls and he
donned a silk hat for the occasion, as appropriate
to the dignified exercise of his franchise.</p>

<p>There was a distinct type of restless, adventurous
pioneer who liked to keep a little ahead
of civilization; who found that he could not
breathe freely when his farm, acquainted for
only a few years with the plough, became the
centre of a neighborhood. Men of this sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
persuaded themselves that there was better
land to be had farther on, though, more or less
consciously, it was freedom they craved. The
exodus of the Lincolns from Kentucky through
Indiana, where they lingered fourteen years
before seeking a new home in Illinois, is typical
of the pioneer restlessness. In a day when the
effects of a household could be moved in one
wagon and convoyed by the family on horseback,
these transitions were undertaken with
the utmost light-heartedness. Only a little
while ago I heard a woman of eighty describe
her family&#8217;s removal from Kentucky to Illinois,
a wide d&eacute;tour being made that they might visit
a distant relative in central Indiana. This,
from her recital, must have been the jolliest
of excursions, for the children at least, with the
daily experiences of fording streams, the constant
uncertainties as to the trail, and the camping
out in the woods when no cabin offered
shelter.</p>

<p>It was a matter of pride with the housewife
to make generous provision for &#8220;company,&#8221;
and the pioneer annalists dwell much upon the
good provender of those days, when venison
and wild turkeys were to be had for the killing
and corn pone or dodger was the only bread.
The reputation of being a good cook was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
as honorable as that of being a successful farmer
or a lucky hunter. The Princeton University
Press has lately resurrected and republished
&#8220;The New Purchase,&#8221; by Baynard Rush Hall,
a graduate of Union College and of Princeton
Theological Seminary, one of the raciest and
most amusing of mid-Western chronicles. Hall
sought &#8220;a life of poetry and romance amid the
rangers of the wood,&#8221; and in 1823 became principal
of Indiana Seminary, the precursor of the
State University. Having enjoyed an ampler
experience of life than his neighbors, he was
able to view the pioneers with a degree of detachment,
though sympathetically.</p>

<p>No other contemporaneous account of the
social life of the period approaches this for
fulness; certainly none equals it in humor.
The difficulties of transportation, the encompassing
wilderness all but impenetrable, the
oddities of frontier character, the simple menage
of the pioneer, his food, and the manner of its
preparation, and the general social spectacle,
are described by a master reporter. One of
his best chapters is devoted to a wedding and
the subsequent feast, where a huge potpie was
the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance. He estimates that at
least six hens, two chanticleers, and four pullets
were lodged in this doughy sepulchre, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
was encircled by roast wild turkeys &#8220;stuffed&#8221;
with Indian meal and sausages. Otherwise
there were fried venison, fried turkey, fried
chicken, fried duck, fried pork, and, he adds,
&#8220;for anything I knew, even fried leather!&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The pioneer adventure in the trans-Mississippi
States differed materially from that of
the timbered areas of the old Northwest Territory.
I incline to the belief that the forest
primeval had a socializing effect upon those
who first dared its fastnesses, binding the lonely
pioneers together by mysterious ties which the
open plain lacked. The Southern infusion in
the States immediately north of the Ohio undoubtedly
influenced the early social life greatly.
The Kentuckian, for example, carried his passion
for sociability into Indiana, and pages of
pioneer history in the Hoosier State might have
been lifted bodily from Kentucky chronicles,
so similar is their flavor. The Kentuckian was
always essentially social; he likes &#8220;the swarm,&#8221;
remarks Mr. James Lane Allen. To seek a
contrast, the early social picture in Kansas is
obscured by the fury of the battle over slavery
that dominates the foreground. Other States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
fought Indians and combated hunger, survived
malaria, brimstone and molasses and calomel,
and kept in good humor, but the settlement of
Kansas was attended with battle, murder, and
sudden death. The pioneers of the Northwest
Territory began life in amiable accord with
their neighbors; Kansas gained Statehood after
a bitter war with her sister Missouri, though
the contest may not be viewed as a local disturbance,
but as a &#8220;curtain raiser&#8221; for the
drama of the Civil War. When in the strenuous
fifties Missouri undertook to colonize the Kansas
plains with pro-slavery sympathizers, New England
rose in majesty to protest. She not only
protested vociferously but sent colonies to hold
the plain against the invaders. Life in the
Kansas of those years of strife was unrelieved
by any gayeties. One searches in vain for traces
of the comfort and cheer that are a part of the
tradition of the settlement of the Ohio valley
States. Professor Spring, in his history of Kansas,
writes: &#8220;For amusement the settlers were
left entirely to their own resources. Lectures,
concert troupes, and shows never ventured far
into the wilderness. Yet there was much broad,
rollicking, noisy merrymaking, but it must be
confessed that rum and whiskey&mdash;lighter
liquors like wine and beer could not be obtained&mdash;had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
a good deal to do with it....
Schools, churches, and the various appliances
of older civilization got under way and made
some growth; but they were still in a primitive,
inchoate condition when Kansas took her place
in the Union.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is hardly another American State in
which the social organization may be observed as
readily as in Kansas. For the reason that its
history and the later &#8220;social scene&#8221; constitute
so compact a picture I find myself returning
to it frequently for illustrations and comparisons.
Born amid tribulation, having indeed
been subjected to the ordeal of fire, Kansas
marks Puritanism&#8217;s farthest west; her people
are still proud to call their State &#8220;The Child
of Plymouth Rock.&#8221; The New Englanders
who settled the northeastern part of the Territory
were augmented after the Civil War by
men of New England stock who had established
themselves in Ohio, Illinois, and Iowa when
the war began, and having acquired soldiers&#8217;
homestead rights made use of them to pre-empt
land in the younger commonwealth. The influx
of veterans after Appomattox sealed the
right of Kansas to be called a typical American
State. &#8220;Kansas sent practically every able-bodied
man of military age to the Civil War,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
says Mr. William Allen White, &#8220;and when they
came back literally hundreds of thousands of
other soldiers came with them and took homesteads.&#8221;
For thirty years after Kansas attained
Statehood her New Englanders were a dominating
factor in her development, and their influence
is still clearly perceptible. The State
may be considered almost as one vast plantation,
peopled by industrious, aspiring men and
women. Class distinctions are little known;
snobbery, where it exists, hides itself to avoid
ridicule; the State abounds in the &#8220;comfortably
well off&#8221; and the &#8220;well-to-do&#8221;; millionaires
are few and well tamed; every other family
boasts an automobile.</p>

<p>While the political and economic results of
the Civil War have been much written of, its
influence upon the common relationships of
life in the border States that it so profoundly
affected are hardly less interesting. The pioneer
period was becoming a memory, the conditions
of life had grown comfortable, and there was
ease in Zion when the young generation met
a new demand upon their courage. Many were
permanently lifted out of the sphere to which
they were born and thrust forth into new avenues
of opportunity. This was not of course peculiar
to the West, though in the Mississippi valley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the effects were so closely intermixed with those
of the strenuous post-bellum political history
that they are indelibly written into the record.
Local hostilities aroused by the conflict were of
long duration; the copperhead was never forgiven
for his disloyalty; it is remembered to
this day against his descendants. Men who,
in all likelihood, would have died in obscurity
but for the changes and chances of war rose
to high position. The most conspicuous of such
instances is afforded by Grant, whose circumstances
and prospects were the poorest when
Fame flung open her doors to him.</p>

<p>Nothing pertaining to the war of the sixties
impresses the student more than the rapidity
with which reputations were made or lost or
the effect upon the participants of their military
experiences. From farms, shops, and
offices men were flung into the most stirring
scenes the nation had known. They emerged
with the glory of battle upon them to become
men of mark in their communities, wearing a
new civic and social dignity. It would be interesting
to know how many of the survivors
attained civil office as the reward of their valor;
in the Western States I should say that few
escaped some sort of recognition on the score
of their military services. In the city that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
know best of all, where for three decades at
least the most distinguished citizens&mdash;certainly
the most respected and honored&mdash;were
veterans of the Civil War, it has always seemed
to me remarkable and altogether reassuring as
proof that we need never fear the iron collar
of militarism, that those men of the sixties so
quickly readjusted themselves in peaceful occupations.
There were those who capitalized
their military achievements, but the vast number
had gone to war from the highest patriotic motives
and, having done their part, were glad to
be quit of it. The shifting about and the new
social experiences were responsible for many
romances. Men met and married women of
whose very existence they would have been
ignorant but for the fortunes of war, and in
these particulars history was repeating itself
last year before our greatest military adventure
had really begun!</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of thousands of khaki-clad
young men in the summer and fall of 1917
marked a new point of orientation in American
life. Romance mounted his charger again;
everywhere one met the wistful war bride. The
familiar academic ceremonials of college commencements
in the West as in the East were
transformed into tributes to the patriotism of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the graduates and undergraduates already under
arms and present in their new uniforms. These
young men, encountered in the street, in clubs,
in hurried visits to their offices as they transferred
their affairs to other hands, were impressively
serious and businesslike. In the
training-camps one heard familiar college songs
rather than battle hymns. Even country-club
dances and other functions given for the
entertainment of the young soldiers were lacking
in light-heartedness. In a Minneapolis
country club much affected by candidates for
commissions at Fort Snelling, the Saturday-night
dances closed with the playing of &#8220;The
Star-Spangled Banner&#8221;; every face turned instantly
toward the flag; every hand came to
salute; and the effect was to send the whole
company, young and old, soberly into the night.
In the three training and mobilizing camps that
I visited through the first months of preparation&mdash;Forts
Benjamin Harrison, Sheridan, and
Snelling&mdash;there was no ignoring the quiet,
dogged attitude of the sons of the West, who
had no hatred for the people they were enlisted
to fight (I heard many of them say this), but
were animated by a feeling that something
greater even than the dignity and security of
this nation, something of deep import to the
whole world had called them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In &#8220;The American Scene&#8221; Mr. James ignored
the West, perhaps as lacking in those backgrounds
and perspectives that most strongly
appealed to him. It is for the reason that &#8220;polite
society,&#8221; as we find it in Western cities,
has only the scant pioneer background that I
have indicated that it is so surprising in the
dignity and richness of its manifestations. If
it is a meritorious thing for people in prosperous
circumstances to spend their money generously
and with good taste in the entertainment of
their friends, to effect combinations of the congenial
in balls, dinners, musicals, and the like,
then the social spectacle in the Western provinces
is not a negligible feature of their activities. If
an aristocracy is a desirable thing in America,
the West can, in its cities great and small, produce
it, and its quality and tone will be found
quite similar to the aristocracy of older communities.
We of the West are not so callous
as our critics would have us appear, and we
are only politely tolerant of the persistence with
which fiction and the drama are illuminated
with characters whose chief purpose is to illustrate
the raw vulgarity of Western civilization.
Such persons are no more acceptable socially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
in Chicago, Minneapolis, or Denver than they
are in New York. The country is so closely
knit together that a fashionable gathering in
one place presents very much the appearance
of a similar function in another. New York,
socially speaking, is very hospitable to the
Southerner; the South has a tradition of aristocracy
that the West lacks. In both New
York and Boston a very different tone characterizes
the mention of a Southern girl and
any reference to a daughter of the West. The
Western girl may be every bit as &#8220;nice&#8221; and
just as cultivated as the Southern girl: they
would be indistinguishable one from the other
save for the Southern girl&#8217;s speech, which we
discover to be not provincial but &#8220;so charmingly
Southern.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps I may here safely record my impatience
of the pretension that provincialism is
anywhere admirable. A provincial character
may be interesting and amusing as a type; he
may be commendably curious about a great number
of things and even possess considerable information,
without being blessed with the vision
to correlate himself with the world beyond the
nearest haystack. I do not share the opinion
of some of my compatriots of the Western
provinces that our speech is really the standard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
English, that the Western voice is impeccable,
or that culture and manners have attained
among us any noteworthy dignity that entitles
us to strut before the rest of the world. Culture
is not a term to be used lightly, and culture,
as, say, Matthew Arnold understood it
and labored to extend its sphere, is not more
respected in these younger States than elsewhere
in America. We are offering innumerable
vehicles of popular education; we point with
pride to public schools, State and privately
endowed universities, and to smaller colleges
of the noblest standards and aims; but, even
with these so abundantly provided, it cannot
be maintained that culture in its strict sense
cries insistently to the Western imagination.
There are people of culture, yes; there are
social expressions both interesting and charming;
but our preoccupations are mainly with
the utilitarian, an attitude wholly defensible
and explainable in the light of our newness,
the urgent need of bread-winning in our recent
yesterdays. However, with the easing in the
past fifty years of the conditions of life there
followed quite naturally a restlessness, an eagerness
to fill and drain the cup of enjoyment, that
was only interrupted by our entrance into the
world war. There are people, rich and poor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
in these States who are devotedly attached to
&#8220;whatsoever things are lovely,&#8221; but that they
exert any wide influence or color deeply the
social fabric is debatable. It is possible that
&#8220;sweetness and light,&#8221; as we shall ultimately
attain them, will not be an efflorescence of literature
or the fine arts, but a realization of justice,
highly conceived, and a perfected system of
government that will assure the happiness,
contentment, and peace of the great body of
our citizenry.</p>

<p>In the smaller Western towns, especially
where the American stock is dominant, lines
of social demarcation are usually obscure to
the vanishing-point. Schools and churches are
here a democratizing factor, and a woman who
&#8220;keeps help&#8221; is very likely to be apologetic
about it; she is anxious to avoid the appearance
of &#8220;uppishness&#8221;&mdash;an unpardonable sin.
It is impossible for her to ignore the fact that
the &#8220;girl&#8221; in her kitchen has, very likely, gone
to school with her children or has been a member
of her Sunday-school class. The reluctance
of American girls to accept employment as
house-servants is an aversion not to be overcome
in the West. Thousands of women in
comfortable conditions of life manage their
homes without outside help other than that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
a neighborhood man or a versatile syndicate
woman who &#8220;comes in&#8221; to assist in a weekly
cleaning.</p>

<p>There is a type of small-town woman who
makes something quite casual and incidental
of the day&#8217;s tasks. Her social enjoyments are
in no way hampered if, in entertaining company,
she prepares with her own hands the
viands for the feast. She takes the greatest
pride in her household; she is usually a capital
cook and is not troubled by any absurd feeling
that she has &#8220;demeaned&#8221; herself by preparing
and serving a meal. She does this exceedingly
well, and rises without embarrassment to change
the plates and bring in the salad. The salad is
excellent and she knows it is excellent and submits
with becoming modesty to praise of her
handiwork. In homes which it is the highest
privilege to visit a joke is made of the housekeeping.
The lady of the house performs the
various rites in keeping with maternal tradition
and the latest approved text-books. You may,
if you like, accompany her to the kitchen and
watch the broiling of your chop, noting the perfection
of the method before testing the result,
and all to the accompaniment of charming talk
about life and letters or what you will. Corporate
feeding in public mess-halls will make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
slow headway with these strongly individualistic
women of the new generation who read prodigiously,
manage a baby with their eyes on
Pasteur, and are as proud of their biscuits
as of their club papers, which we know to be
admirable.</p>

<p>Are women less prone to snobbishness than
men? Contrary to the general opinion, I think
they are. Their gentler natures shrink from unkindness,
from the petty cruelties of social differentiation
which may be made very poignant
in a town of five or ten thousand people, where
one cannot pretend with any degree of plausibility
that one does not know one&#8217;s neighbor, or
that the daughter of a section foreman or the
son of the second-best grocer did not sit beside
one&#8217;s own Susan or Thomas in the public school.
The banker&#8217;s offspring may find the children of
the owner of the stave-factory or the planing-mill
more congenial associates than the children
on the back streets; but when the banker&#8217;s
wife gives a birthday party for Susan the invitations
are not limited to the children of the
immediate neighbors but include every child in
town who has the slightest claim upon her hospitality.
The point seems to be established
that one may be poor and yet be &#8220;nice&#8221;; and
this is a very comforting philosophy and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
mean touchstone of social fitness. I may add
that the mid-Western woman, in spite of her
strong individualism in domestic matters, is,
broadly speaking, fundamentally socialistic. She
is the least bit uncomfortable at the thought of
inequalities of privilege and opportunity. Not
long ago I met in Chicago an old friend, a man
who has added greatly to an inherited fortune.
To my inquiry as to what he was doing in town
he replied ruefully that he was going to buy his
wife some clothes! He explained that in her
preoccupation with philanthropy and social
welfare she had grown not merely indifferent
to the call of fashion, but that she seriously
questioned her right to adorn herself while
her less-favored sisters suffered for life&#8217;s necessities.
This is an extreme case, though I can
from my personal acquaintance duplicate it
in half a dozen instances of women born to
ease and able to command luxury who very
sincerely share this feeling.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The social edifice is like a cabinet of file-boxes
conveniently arranged so that they may be
drawn out and pondered by the curious. The
seeker of types is so prone to look for the eccentric,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the fantastic (and I am not without
my interest in these varieties), which so astonishingly
repeat themselves, that he is likely
to ignore the claims of the normal, the real
&#8220;folksy&#8221; bread-and-butter people who are, after
all, the mainstay of our democracy. They are
not to be scornfully waved aside as bourgeoisie,
or prodded with such ironies as Arnold applied
to the middle class in England. They
constitute the most interesting and admirable
of our social strata. There is nothing quite
like them in any other country; nowhere else
have comfort, opportunity, and aspiration produced
the same combination.</p>

<p>The traveller&#8217;s curiosity is teased constantly,
as he cruises through the towns and cities of
the Middle West, by the numbers of homes
that cannot imaginably be maintained on less
than five thousand dollars a year. The
economic basis of these establishments invites
speculation; in my own city I am ignorant of
the means by which hundreds of such homes
are conducted&mdash;homes that testify to the
West&#8217;s growing good taste in domestic architecture
and shelter people whose ambitions are
worthy of highest praise. There was a time
not so remote when I could identify at sight
every pleasure vehicle in town. A man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
kept a horse and buggy was thought to be
&#8220;putting on&#8221; a little; if he set up a carriage
and two horses he was, unless he enjoyed public
confidence in the highest degree, viewed with
distrust and suspicion. When in the eighties
an Indianapolis bank failed, a cynical old citizen
remarked of its president that &#8220;no wonder
Blank busted, swelling &#8217;round in a carriage
with a nigger in uniform&#8221;! Nowadays thousands
of citizens blithely disport themselves
in automobiles that cost several times the value
of that banker&#8217;s equipage. I have confided
my bewilderment to friends in other cities and
find the same ignorance of the economic foundation
of this prosperity. The existence, in
cities of one, two, and three hundred thousand
people of so many whom we may call non-producers&mdash;professional
men, managers, agents&mdash;offers
a stimulating topic for a doctoral thesis.
I am not complaining of this phenomenon&mdash;I
merely wonder about it.</p>

<p>The West&#8217;s great natural wealth and extraordinary
development is nowhere more strikingly
denoted than in the thousands of comfortable
homes, in hundreds of places, set on forty or
eighty foot lots that were tilled land or forest
fifty or twenty years ago. Cruising through
the West, one enters every city through new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
additions, frequently sliced out of old forests,
with the maples, elms, or beeches carefully
retained. Bungalows are inadvertently jotted
down as though enthusiastic young architects
were using the landscape for sketch-paper. I
have inspected large settlements in which no
two of these habitations are alike, though the
difference may be only a matter of pulling the
roof a little lower over the eyes of the veranda
or some idiosyncrasy in the matter of the chimney.
The trolley and the low-priced automobile
are continually widening the urban arc, so that
the acre lot or even a larger estate is within
the reach of city-dwellers who have a weakness
for country air and home-grown vegetables.
A hedge, a second barricade of hollyhocks, a
flower-box on the veranda rail, and a splash
of color when the crimson ramblers are in bloom&mdash;here
the hunter of types keeps his note-book
in hand and wishes that Henry Cuyler Bunner
were alive to bring his fine perceptions and
sympathies to bear upon these homes and their
attractive inmates.</p>

<p>The young woman we see inspecting the
mignonette or admonishing the iceman to
greater punctuality in his deliveries, would
have charmed a lyric from Aldrich. The new
additions are, we know, contrived for her special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
delight. She and her neighbors are not to be
confounded with young wives in apartments
with kitchenette attached who lean heavily
upon the delicatessen-shop and find their sole
intellectual stimulus in vaudeville or the dumb
drama. It is inconceivable that any one should
surprise the mistresses of these bungalows in
a state of untidiness, that their babies should
not be sound and encouraging specimens of
the human race, or that the arrival of unexpected
guests should not find their pantries
fortified with delicious strawberries or transparent
jellies of their own conserving. These
young women and their equally young husbands
are the product of the high schools, or
perhaps they have been fellow students in a
State university. With all the world before
them where to choose and Providence their
guide, they have elected to attack life together
and they go about it joyfully. Let no one
imagine that they lead starved lives or lack
social diversion. Do the housekeepers not
gather on one another&#8217;s verandas every summer
afternoon to discuss the care of infants or wars
and rumors of wars; and is there not tennis
when their young lords come home? On occasions
of supreme indulgence the neighborhood
laundress watches the baby while they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
go somewhere to dance or to a play, lecture, or
concert in town. They are all musical; indeed,
the whole Middle West is melodious with
the tinklings of what Mr. George Ade, with
brutal impiety, styles &#8220;the upright agony box.&#8221;
Or, denied the piano, these habitations at least
boast the tuneful disk and command at will
the voices of Farrar and Caruso.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>It is in summer that the Middle Western
provinces most candidly present themselves,
not only because the fields then publish their
richness but for the ease with which the people
may be observed. The study of types may
then be pursued along the multitudinous avenues
in which the Folks disport themselves in
search of pleasure. The smoothing-out processes,
to which schools, tailors, dressmakers, and
&#8220;shine-&#8217;em&#8221; parlors contribute, add to the perils
of the type-hunter. Mr. Howells&#8217;s remark of
twenty years ago or more, that the polish slowly
dims on footgear as one travels westward, has
ceased to be true; types once familiar are so
disguised or modified as to be unrecognizable.
Even the Western county-seat, long rich in
&#8220;character,&#8221; now flaunts the smartest apparel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
in its shop-windows, and when it reappears in
Main Street upon the forms of the citizens one
is convinced of the local prosperity and good
taste. The keeper of the livery-stable, a stout
gentleman, who knows every man, woman,
and child in the county and aspires to the
shrievalty, has bowed before the all-pervasive
automobile. He has transformed his stable
into a garage (with a plate-glass &#8220;front&#8221; exposing
the latest model) and hides his galluses
(shamelessly exhibited in the day of the horse)
under a coat of modish cut, in deference to
the sensibilities of lady patrons. The country
lawyer is abandoning the trailing frock
coat, once the sacred vestment of his profession,
having found that the wrinkled tails
evoked unfavorable comment from his sons
and daughters when they came home from
college. The village drunkard is no longer
pointed out commiseratingly; local option and
State-wide prohibition have destroyed his usefulness
as an awful example, and his resourcefulness
is taxed to the utmost that he may keep
tryst with the skulking bootlegger.</p>

<p>Every town used to have a usurer, a merchant
who was &#8220;mean&#8221; (both of these were
frequently pillars in the church), and a dishevelled
photographer whose artistic ability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
was measured by the success of his efforts to
make the baby laugh. He solaced himself with
the flute or violin between &#8220;sittings,&#8221; not wholly
without reference to the charms of the milliner
over the way. In the towns I have in mind
there was always the young man who would
have had a brilliant career but for his passion
for gambling, the aleatory means of his destruction
being an all-night poker-game in the
back room of his law-office opposite the court-house.
He may appropriately be grouped with
the man who had been ruined by &#8220;going security&#8221;
for a friend, who was spoken of pityingly
while the beneficiary of his misplaced confidence,
having gained affluence, was execrated. The race
is growing better and wiser, and by one means
and another these types have been forced from the
stage; or perhaps more properly it should be said
that the stage and the picture-screen alone seem
unaware that they have passed into oblivion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The Municipal Recreation Pier, Chicago.</p>

<p>The town band remains, however, and it is
one of the mysteries of our civilization that
virtuosi, capable of performing upon any instrument,
exist in the smallest hamlet and meet
every Saturday night for practice in the lodge-room
over the grocery. I was both auditor and
spectator of such a rehearsal one night last
summer, in a small town in Illinois. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
garage across the street it was possible to hear
and see the artists, and to be aware of the leader&#8217;s
zeal and his stern, critical attitude toward the
performers. He seized first the cornet and then
the trombone (Hoosierese, sliphorn) to demonstrate
the proper phrasing of a difficult passage.
The universal Main Street is made festive
on summer nights by the presence of the
town&#8217;s fairest daughters, clothed in white samite,
mystic, wonderful, who know every one and
gossip democratically with their friend the white-jacketed
young man who lords it at the druggist&#8217;s
soda-fountain. Such a group gathered
and commented derisively upon the experiments
of the musicians. That the cornetist was in
private life an assistant to the butcher touched
their humor; the evocation of melody and the
purveying of meat seemed to them irreconcilable.
In every such town there is a male quartette
that sings the old-time melodies at church
entertainments and other gatherings. These
vocalists add to the joy of living, and I should
lament their passing. Their efforts are more
particularly pleasing when, supplemented by
guitar and banjo, they move through verdurous
avenues thrumming and singing as they go.
Somewhere a lattice opens guardedly&mdash;how
young the world is!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>The adventurous boy who, even in times of
peace, was scornful of formal education and
ran away to enlist in the navy or otherwise
sought to widen the cramped horizons of home&mdash;and
every town has this boy&mdash;still reappears
at intervals to report to his parents and
submit to the admiration and envy of his old
schoolmates in the Main Street bazaars. This
type endures and will, very likely, persist while
there are seas to cross and battles to be won.
The trumpetings of war stir the blood of such
youngsters, and since our entrance into the war
it has been my fortune to know many of them,
who were anxious to dare the skies or play with
death in the waters under the earth. The West
has no monopoly of courage or daring, but it
was reassuring to find that the best blood of
the Great Valley thrilled to the cry of the bugle.
On a railway-train I fell into talk with a young
officer of the national army. Finding that I
knew the president of the Western college that
he had attended, he sketched for me a career
which, in view of his twenty-six years, was almost
incredible. At eighteen he had enlisted in
the navy in the hope of seeing the world, but
had been assigned to duty as a hospital orderly.
Newport had been one of his stations; there
and at other places where he had served he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
spent his spare hours in study. When he was
discharged he signed papers on a British merchant
vessel. The ship was short-handed and
he was enrolled as an able seaman, which, he
said, was an unwarranted compliment, as he
proved to the captain&#8217;s satisfaction when he
was sent to the wheel and nearly (as he put it)
bowled over a lighthouse. His voyages had
carried him to the Orient and the austral seas.
After these wanderings he was realizing an
early ambition to go to college when the war-drum
sounded. He had taken the training at
an officer&#8217;s reserve camp and was on his way to
his first assignment. The town he mentioned
as his home is hardly more than a whistling-point
for locomotives, and I wondered later,
as I flashed through it, just what stirring of the
spirit had made its peace intolerable and sent
him roaming.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> At a club dinner I met another
man, born not far from the town that produced
my sailor-soldier, who had fought with the
Canadian troops from the beginning of the
war until discharged because of wounds received
on the French front. His pocketful of
medals&mdash;he carried them boyishly, like so
many marbles, in his trousers pocket!&mdash;included
the <i>croix de guerre</i>, and he had been
decorated at Buckingham Palace by King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
George. He had been a wanderer from boyhood,
his father told me, visiting every part of
the world that promised adventure and, incidentally,
was twice wounded in the Boer War.</p>

<p>The evolution of a type is not, with Mother
Nature, a hasty business, and in attempting
to answer an inquiry for a definition of the
typical mid-Western girl, I am disposed to
spare myself humiliating refutations by declaring
that there is no such thing. In the
Rocky Mountain States and in California, we
know, if the motion-picture purveyors may
be trusted, that the typical young woman of
those regions always wears a sombrero and
lives upon the back of a bronco. However, in
parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, where there
has been a minimum of intermixture since the
original settlements, one is fairly safe in the
choice of types. I shall say that in this particular
territory the typical young woman is brown-haired,
blue or brown of eye, of medium height,
with a slender, mobile face that is reminiscent
of Celtic influences. Much Scotch-Irish blood
flowed into the Ohio valley in the early immigration,
and the type survives. In the streets
and in public gatherings in Wisconsin and
Minnesota the German and Scandinavian infusion
is clearly manifest. On the lake-docks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
and in lumber-camps the big fellows of the
North in their Mackinaw coats and close-fitting
knit caps impart a heroic note to the landscape.
In January, 1917, having gone to St. Paul to
witness the winter carnival, I was struck by the
great number of tall, fair men who, in their gay
holiday attire, satisfied the most exacting ideal
of the children of the vikings. They trod the
snow with kingly majesty, and to see their performances
on skis is to be persuaded that the
sagas do not exaggerate the daring of their
ancestors.</p>

<p>The search for characteristic traits is likely
to be more fruitful of tangible results than the
attempt to fix physical types, and the Western
girl who steps from the high schools to the State
universities that so hospitably open their doors
to her may not be <i>the</i> type, but she is indubitably
<i>a</i> type, well defined. The lore of the ages
has been preserved and handed down for her
special benefit and she absorbs and assimilates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
it with ease and grace. Man is no enigma to
her; she begins her analysis of the male in high
school, and the university offers a post-graduate
course in the species. Young men are not more
serious over the affairs of their Greek-letter
societies than these young women in the management
of their sororities, which seem, after school-days,
to call for constant reunions. It is not
surprising that the Western woman has so valiantly
fought for and won recognition of her
rights as a citizen. A girl who has matched
her wits against boys in the high school and
again in a State university, and very likely has
surpassed them in scholarship, must be forgiven
for assuming that the civil rights accorded them
cannot fairly be withheld from her. The many
thousands of young women who have taken
degrees in these universities have played havoc
with the Victorian tradition of womanhood.
They constitute an independent, self-assured
body, zealous in social and civic service, and
not infrequently looking forward to careers.</p>

<p>The State university is truly a well-spring
of democracy; this may not be said too emphatically.
There is evidence of the pleasantest
comradeship between men and women students,
and one is impressed in classrooms by the prevailing
good cheer and earnestness.</p>

<div class="verse">And sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Mild flirtations are not regarded as detrimental
to the attainment of sound or even
distinguished scholarship. The university&#8217;s social
life may be narrow, but it is ampler than
that of the farm or &#8220;home town.&#8221; Against
the argument that these institutions tend to
the promotion of provincial insularity, it may
be said that there is a compensating benefit
in the mingling of students drawn largely from
a single commonwealth. A gentleman whose
education was gained in one of the older Eastern
universities and in Europe remarked to me
that, as his son expected to succeed him in the
law, he was sending him to the university of
his own State, for the reason that he would
meet there young men whose acquaintance
would later be of material assistance to him
in his profession.</p>

<p>The value of the Great Lakes as a social and
recreational medium is hardly less than their
importance as commercial highways. The saltless
seas are lined with summer colonies and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
all the lake cities piers and beaches are a boon
to the many who seek relief from the heat which
we of the West always speak of defensively as
essential to the perfecting of the corn that is
our pride. Chicago&#8217;s joke that it is the best of
summer resorts is not without some foundation;
certainly one may find there every variety of
amusement except salt-water bathing. The
salt&#8217;s stimulus is not missed apparently by the
vast number of citizens&mdash;estimated at two
hundred thousand daily during the fiercest
heat&mdash;who disport themselves on the shore.
The new municipal pier is a prodigious structure,
and I know of no place in America where
the student of mankind may more profitably
plant himself for an evening of contemplation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="" /></div>

A popular bathing beach on Lake Erie, near the
town of Sandusky.</p>

<p>What struck me in a series of observations
of the people at play, extending round the lakes
from Chicago to Cleveland, was the general
good order and decorum. At Detroit I was introduced
to two dancing pavilions on the riverside,
where the prevailing sobriety was most
depressing in view of my promise to the illustrator
that somewhere in our pilgrimage I
should tax his powers with scenes of depravity
and violence. A quarter purchased a string of
six tickets, and one of these deposited in a box
entitled the owner to take the floor with a partner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
As soon as a dance and its several encores
was over the floor cleared instantly and one
was required to relinquish another ticket. There
and in a similar dance-hall in a large Cleveland
amusement park fully one-third of the patrons
were young women who danced together
throughout the evening, and often children
tripped into the picture. Chaperonage was afforded
by vigilant parents comfortably established
in the balcony. The Cleveland resort,
accessible to any one for a small fee, interested
me particularly because the people were so
well apparelled, so &#8220;good-looking,&#8221; and the
atmosphere was so charged with the spirit of
neighborliness. The favorite dances there were
the waltz (old style), the fox-trot, and the
schottische. I confess that this recrudescence
of the schottische in Cleveland, a progressive
city that satisfies so many of the cravings of
the aspiring soul&mdash;the home of three-cent car-fares
and a noble art museum&mdash;greatly astonished
me. But for the fact that warning of
each number was flashed on the wall I should
not have trusted my judgment that what I
beheld was, indeed, the schottische. Frankly
I do not care for the schottische, and it may
have been that my tone or manner betokened
resentment at its revival; at any rate a policeman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
whom I interviewed outside the pavilion
eyed me with suspicion when I expressed surprise
that the schottische was so frequently announced.
When I asked why the one-step was
ignored utterly he replied contemptuously that
no doubt I could find places around Cleveland
where that kind of rough stuff was permitted,
but &#8220;it don&#8217;t go <i>here</i>!&#8221; I did not undertake
to defend the one-step to so stern a moralist,
though it was in his eye that he wished me to
do so that he might reproach me for my worldliness.
I do not believe he meant to be unjust
or harsh or even that he appraised me at once
as a seeker of the rough stuff he abhorred; I
had merely provided him with an excuse for
proclaiming the moral standards of the city
of Cleveland, which are high. I made note of
the persistence of the Puritan influence in the
Western Reserve and hastily withdrew in the
direction of the trolley.</p>

<p>Innumerable small lakes lie within the far-flung
arms of the major lakes adding variety
and charm to a broad landscape, and offering
summer refuge to a host of vacationists.
Northern Indiana is plentifully sprinkled with
lakes and ponds; in Michigan, Wisconsin, and
Minnesota there are thousands of them. I am
moved to ask&mdash;is a river more companionable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
than a lake? I had always felt that a river
had the best of the argument, as more neighborly
and human, and I am still disposed to
favor those streams of Maine that are played
upon by the tides; but an acquaintance with
a great number of these inland saucerfuls of
blue water has made me their advocate. Happy
is the town that has a lake for its back yard!
The lakes of Minneapolis (there are ten within
the municipal limits) are the distinguishing
feature of that city. They seem to have been
planted just where they are for the sole purpose
of adorning it, and they have been protected
and utilized with rare prevision and
judgment. To those who would chum with a
river, St. Paul offers the Mississippi, where
the battlements of the University Club project
over a bluff from which the Father of Waters
may be admired at leisure, and St. Paul will,
if you insist, land you in one of the most delightful
of country clubs on the shore of White
Bear Lake. I must add that the country club
has in the Twin Cities attained a rare state of
perfection. That any one should wing far afield
from either town in summer seems absurd, so
blest are both in opportunities for outdoor
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Just how far the wide-spread passion for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
knitting has interfered with more vigorous
sports among our young women I am unable
to say, but the loss to links and courts in the
Western provinces must have been enormous.
The Minikahda Club of Minneapolis was illuminated
one day by a girls&#8217; luncheon. These
radiant young beings entered the dining-room
knitting&mdash;knitting as gravely as though they
were weaving the destinies of nations&mdash;and
maybe they were! The small confusions and
perplexities of seating the party of thirty were
increased by the dropping of balls of yarn&mdash;and
stitches! The round table seemed to be looped
with yarn, as though the war overseas were
tightening its cords about those young women,
whose brothers and cousins and sweethearts
were destined to the battle-line.</p>

<p class="caption">On a craft plying the waters of Erie I found all of the conditions of a happy<br />
outing and types that it is always a joy to meet.</p>

<p>Longfellow celebrated in song &#8220;The Four
Lakes of Madison,&#8221; which he apostrophized
as &#8220;lovely handmaids.&#8221; I treasure the memory
of an approach round one of these lakes to
Wisconsin&#8217;s capitol (one of the few American
State-houses that doesn&#8217;t look like an appropriation!)
through a mist that imparted to the
dome an inthralling illusion of detachment
from the main body of the building. The
first star twinkled above it; perhaps it was
Wisconsin&#8217;s star that had wandered out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
galaxy to symbolize for an hour the State&#8217;s
sovereignty!</p>



<p>Whatever one may miss on piers and in
amusement parks in the way of types may be
sought with confidence on the excursion steamers
that ply the lakes&mdash;veritable arks in which
humanity in countless varieties may be observed.
The voyager is satisfied that the banana
and peanut and the innocuous &#8220;pop&#8221; are the
ambrosia and nectar of our democracy. Before
the boat leaves the dock the deck is littered;
one&#8217;s note-book bristles with memoranda of
the untidiness and disorder. On a craft plying
the waters of Erie I found all the conditions
of a happy outing and types that it is always a
joy to meet. The village &#8220;cut-up,&#8221; dashingly
perched on the rail; the girl who is never so
happy as when organizing and playing games;
the young man who yearns to join her group,
but is prevented by unconquerable shyness;
the child that, carefully planted in the most
crowded and inaccessible part of the deck, develops
a thirst that results in the constant agitation
of half the ship as his needs are satisfied.
There is, inevitably, a woman of superior breeding
who has taken passage on the boat by mistake,
believing it to be first-class, which it so
undeniably is not; and if you wear a sympathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
countenance she will confide to you her
indignation. The crunching of the peanut-shell,
the poignant agony of the child that has loved
the banana not wisely but too well, are an affront
to this lady. She announces haughtily
that she&#8217;s sure the boat is overcrowded, which
it undoubtedly is, and that she means to report
this trifling with human life to the authorities.
That any one should covet the cloistral calm
of a private yacht when the plain folks are so
interesting and amusing is only another proof
of the constant struggle of the aristocratic ideal
to fasten itself upon our continent.</p>

<p class="caption">The Perry monument at Put-in Bay.<br />

A huge column of concrete erected in commemoration<br />
of Commodore Perry&#8217;s victory.</p>

<p>Below there was a dining-saloon, but its
seclusion was not to be preferred to an assault
upon a counter presided over by one of the
most remarkable young men I have ever seen.
He was tall and of a slenderness, with a
wonderful mane of fair hair brushed straight
back from his pale brow. As he tossed sandwiches
and slabs of pie to the importunate he
jerked his hair into place with a magnificent
fling of the head. In moments when the appeals
of starving supplicants became insistent,
and he was confused by the pressure for attention,
he would rake his hair with his fingers,
and then, wholly composed, swing round and
resume the filling of orders. The young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
from the check-room went to his assistance,
but I felt that he resented this as an impertinence,
a reflection upon his prowess. He needed
no assistance; before that clamorous company
he was the pattern of urbanity. His locks were
his strength and his consolation; not once was
his aplomb shaken, not even when a stocky
gentleman fiercely demanded a whole pie!</p>



<p>While Perry&#8217;s monument, a noble seamark
at Put-in-Bay, is a reminder that the lakes
have played their part in American history, it
is at Mackinac that one experiences a sense of
antiquity. The white-walled fort is a link between
the oldest and the newest, and the imagination
quickens at the thought of the first
adventurous white man who ever braved the
uncharted waters; while the eye follows the
interminable line of ore barges bound for the
steel-mills on the southern curve of Michigan
or on the shores of Erie. Commerce in these
waters began with the fur-traders travelling in
canoes; then came sailing vessels carrying
supplies to the new camps and settlements
and returning with lumber or produce; but
to-day sails are rare and the long leviathans,
fascinating in their apparent unwieldiness and
undeniable ugliness, are the dominant medium
of transportation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>One night, a few years ago, on the breezy
terrace of one of the handsomest villas in the
lake region, I talked with the head of a great
industry whose products are known round the
world. His house, furnished with every comfort
and luxury, was gay with music and the
laughter of young folk. Through the straits
crawled the ships, bearing lumber, grain, and
ore, signalling their passing in raucous blasts
to the lookout at St. Ignace. My host spoke
with characteristic simplicity and deep feeling
of the poverty of his youth (he came to America
an immigrant) and of all that America had
meant to him. He was near the end of his days
and I have thought often of that evening, of
his seigniorial dignity and courtesy, of the portrait
he so unconsciously drew of himself against
a background adorned with the rich reward
of his laborious years. And as he talked it
seemed that the power of the West, the prodigious
energies of its forests and fields and
hills, its enormous potentialities of opportunity,
became something concrete and tangible, that
flowed in an irresistible tide through the heart
of the nation.</p>

THE FARMER OF THE MIDDLE WEST</h2>

<p>That it may please Thee to give and preserve to our use the
kindly fruits of the earth, so that in due time we may enjoy

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN spring marches up the Mississippi
valley and the snows of the
broad plains find companionship with
the snows of yesteryear, the traveller, journeying
east or west, is aware that life has awakened
in the fields. The winter wheat lies green upon
countless acres; thousands of ploughshares turn
the fertile earth; the farmer, after the enforced
idleness of winter, is again a man of action.</p>

<p>Last year (1917), that witnessed our entrance
into the greatest of wars, the American farmer
produced 3,159,000,000 bushels of corn, 660,000,000
bushels of wheat, 1,587,000,000 bushels of
oats, 60,000,000 bushels of rye. From the day
of our entrance into the world struggle against
autocracy the American farm has been the
subject of a new scrutiny. In all the chancelleries
of the world crop reports and estimates
are eagerly scanned and tabulated, for while
the war lasts and far into the period of rehabilitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
and reconstruction that will follow,
America must bear the enormous responsibility,
not merely of training and equipping
armies, building ships, and manufacturing munitions,
but of feeding the nations. The farmer
himself is roused to a new consciousness of his
importance; he is aware that thousands of
hands are thrust toward him from over the
sea, that every acre of his soil and every ear
of corn and bushel of wheat in his bins or in
process of cultivation has become a factor in
the gigantic struggle to preserve and widen
the dominion of democracy.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>&#8220;Better be a farmer, son; the corn grows
while you sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>This remark, addressed to me in about my
sixth year by my great-uncle, a farmer in central
Indiana, lingered long in my memory. There
was no disputing his philosophy; corn, intelligently
planted and tended, undoubtedly grows
at night as well as by day. But the choice of
seed demands judgment, and the preparation
of the soil and the subsequent care of the growing
corn exact hard labor. My earliest impressions
of farm life cannot be dissociated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
from the long, laborious days, the monotonous
plodding behind the plough, the incidental
&#8220;chores,&#8221; the constant apprehensions as to
drought or flood. The country cousins I visited
in Indiana and Illinois were all too busy to
have much time for play. I used to sit on the
fence or tramp beside the boys as they drove
the plough, or watch the girls milk the cows or
ply the churn, oppressed by an overmastering
homesickness. And when the night shut down
and the insect chorus floated into the quiet
house the isolation was intensified.</p>

<p>My father and his forebears were born and
bred to the soil; they scratched the earth all
the way from North Carolina into Kentucky
and on into Indiana and Illinois. I had just
returned, last fall, from a visit to the grave of
my grandfather in a country churchyard in
central Illinois, round which the corn stood in
solemn phalanx, when I received a note from
my fifteen-year-old boy, in whom I had hopefully
looked for atavistic tendencies. From
his school in Connecticut he penned these depressing
tidings:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have decided never to be a farmer.
Yesterday the school was marched three miles
to a farm where the boys picked beans all afternoon
and then walked back. Much as I like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
beans and want to help Mr. Hoover conserve
our resources, this was rubbing it in. I never
want to see a bean again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have heard a score of successful business
and professional men say that they intended
to &#8220;make farmers&#8221; of their boys, and a number
of these acquaintances have succeeded in sending
their sons through agricultural schools, but
the great-grandchildren of the Middle Western
pioneers are not easily persuaded that farming
is an honorable calling.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t necessary for gentlemen who watch
the tape for crop forecasts to be able to differentiate
wheat from oats to appreciate the
importance to the prosperous course of general
business of a big yield in the grain-fields; but
to the average urban citizen farming is something
remote and uninteresting, carried on by
men he never meets in regions that he only
observes hastily from a speeding automobile
or the window of a limited train. Great numbers
of Middle Western city men indulge in farming
as a pastime&mdash;and in a majority of cases it is,
from the testimony of these absentee proprietors,
a pleasant recreation but an expensive one.
However, all city men who gratify a weakness
for farming are not faddists; many such land-owners
manage their plantations with intelligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
and make them earn dividends. Mr.
George Ade&#8217;s Indiana farm, Hazelden, is one
of the State&#8217;s show-places. The playwright
and humorist says that its best feature is a
good nine-hole golf-course and a swimming-pool,
but from his &#8220;home plant&#8221; of 400 acres
he cultivates 2,000 acres of fertile Hoosier soil.</p>

<p>A few years ago a manufacturer of my acquaintance,
whose family presents a clear urban
line for a hundred years, purchased a farm on
the edge of a river&mdash;more, I imagine, for the
view it afforded of a pleasant valley than because
of its fertility. An architect entered
sympathetically into the business of making
habitable a century-old log house, a transition
effected without disturbing any of the timbers
or the irregular lines of floors and ceilings. So
much time was spent in these restorations and
readjustments that the busy owner in despair
fell upon a mail-order catalogue to complete
his preparations for occupancy. A barn, tenant&#8217;s
house, poultry-house, pump and windmill, fencing,
and every vehicle and tool needed on the
place, including a barometer and wind-gauge,
he ordered by post. His joy in his acres was
second only to his satisfaction in the ease with
which he invoked all the apparatus necessary
to his comfort. Every item arrived exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
as the catalogue promised; with the hired man&#8217;s
assistance he fitted the houses together and
built a tower for the windmill out of concrete
made in a machine provided by the same establishment.
His only complaint was that the
catalogue didn&#8217;t offer memorial tablets, as he
thought it incumbent upon him to publish in
brass the merits of the obscure pioneer who
had laboriously fashioned his cabin before the
convenient method of post-card ordering had
been discovered.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Imaginative literature has done little to invest
the farm with glamour. The sailor and
the warrior, the fisherman and the hunter are
celebrated in song and story, but the farmer
has inspired no ringing saga or iliad, and the
lyric muse has only added to the general joyless
impression of the husbandman&#8217;s life. Hesiod
and Virgil wrote with knowledge of farming;
Virgil&#8217;s instructions to the ploughman only
need to be hitched to a tractor to bring them
up to date, and he was an authority on weather
signs. But Horace was no farmer; the Sabine
farm is a joke. The best Gray could do for
the farmer was to send him homeward plodding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
his weary way. Burns, at the plough, apostrophized
the daisy, but only by indirection
did he celebrate the joys of farm life. Wordsworth&#8217;s
&#8220;Solitary Reaper&#8221; sang a melancholy
strain; &#8220;Snow-Bound&#8221; offers a genial picture,
but it is of winter-clad fields. Carleton&#8217;s &#8220;Farm
Ballads&#8221; sing of poverty and domestic infelicity.
Riley made a philosopher and optimist of his
Indiana farmer, but his characters are to be
taken as individuals rather than as types. There
is, I suppose, in every Middle Western county
a quizzical, quaint countryman whose sayings
are quoted among his neighbors, but the man
with a hundred acres of land to till, wood to
cut, and stock to feed is not greatly given to
poetry or humor.</p>

<p>English novels of rural life are numerous
but they are usually in a low key. I have a
lingering memory of Hardy&#8217;s &#8220;Woodlanders&#8221;
as a book of charm, and his tragic &#8220;Tess&#8221; is
probably fiction&#8217;s highest venture in this field.
&#8220;Lorna Doone&#8221; I remember chiefly because
it established in me a distaste for mutton.
George Eliot and George Meredith are other
English novelists who have written of farm
life, nor may I forget Mr. Eden Phillpotts.
French fiction, of course, offers brilliant exceptions
to the generalization that literature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
has neglected the farmer; but, in spite of the
vast importance of the farm in American life,
there is in our fiction no farm novel of distinction.
Mr. Hamlin Garland, in &#8220;Main Traveled
Roads&#8221; and in his autobiographical chronicle
&#8220;A Son of the Middle Border,&#8221; has thrust his
plough deep; but the truth as we know it to
be disclosed in these instances is not heartening.
The cowboy is the jolliest figure in our
fiction, the farmer the dreariest. The shepherd
and the herdsman have fared better in all literatures
than the farmer, perhaps because their
vocations are more leisurely and offer opportunities
for contemplation denied the tiller of
the soil. The Hebrew prophets and poets were
mindful of the pictorial and illustrative values
of herd and flock. It is written, &#8220;Our cattle
also shall go with us,&#8221; and, journeying across
the mountain States, where there is always a
herd blurring the range, one thinks inevitably
of man&#8217;s long migration in quest of the Promised
Land.</p>

<p>The French peasant has his place in art, but
here again we are confronted by joylessness,
though I confess that I am resting my case
chiefly upon Millet. What Remington did for
the American cattle-range no one has done for
the farm. Fields of corn and wheat are painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
truthfully and effectively, but the critics have
withheld their highest praise from these performances.
Perhaps a corn-field is not a proper
subject for the painter; or it may be that the
Maine rocks or a group of birches against a
Vermont hillside &#8220;compose&#8221; better or are supported
by a nobler tradition. The most alluring
pictures I recall of farm life have been advertisements
depicting vast fields of wheat through
which the delighted husbandman drives a reaper
with all the jauntiness of a king practising for
a chariot-race.</p>

<p>I have thus run skippingly through the catalogues
of bucolic literature and art to confirm
my impression as a layman that farming is
not an affair of romance, poetry, or pictures,
but a business, exacting and difficult, that may
be followed with success only by industrious
and enlightened practitioners. The first settlers
of the Mississippi valley stand out rather more
attractively than their successors of what I
shall call the intermediate period. There was
no turning back for the pioneers who struck
boldly into the unknown, knowing that if they
failed to establish themselves and solve the
problem of subsisting from the virgin earth
they would perish. The battle was to the strong,
the intelligent, the resourceful. The first years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
on a new farm in wilderness or prairie were a
prolonged contest between man and nature,
nature being as much a foe as an ally. That the
social spark survived amid arduous labor and
daily self-sacrifice is remarkable; that the earth
was subdued to man&#8217;s will and made to yield
him its kindly fruits is a tribute to the splendid
courage and indomitable faith of the settlers.</p>

<p>These Middle Western pioneers were in the
fullest sense the sons of democracy. The
Southern planter with the traditions of the
English country gentleman behind him and,
in slavery time, representing a survival of the
feudal order, had no counterpart in the West,
where the settler was limited in his holdings to
the number of acres that he and his sons could
cultivate by their own labor. I explored, last
year, much of the Valley of Democracy, both
in seed-time and in harvest. We had been
drawn at last into the world war, and its demands
and conjectures as to its outcome were
upon the lips of men everywhere. It was impossible
to avoid reflecting upon the part these
plains have played in the history of America
and the increasing part they are destined to
play in the world history of the future. Every
wheat shoot, every stalk of corn was a new
testimony to the glory of America. Not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
acre of land but had been won by intrepid
pioneers who severed all ties but those that
bound them to an ideal, whose only tangible
expression was the log court-house where they
recorded the deeds for their land or the military
post that afforded them protection. At
Decatur, Illinois, one of these first court-houses
still stands, and we are told that within its walls
Lincoln often pleaded causes. American democracy
could have no finer monument than
this; the imagination quickens at the thought of
similar huts reared by the axes of the pioneers
to establish safeguards of law and order on
new soil almost before they had fashioned their
habitations. It seemed to me that if the Kaiser
had known the spirit in which these august
fields were tamed and peopled, or the aspirations,
the aims and hopes that are represented
in every farmhouse and ranch-house between
the Alleghanies and the Rockies, he would not so
contemptuously have courted our participation
against him in his war for world domination.</p>

<p>What I am calling, for convenience, the intermediate
period in the history of the Mississippi
valley, began when the rough pioneering
was over, and the sons of the first settlers came
into an inheritance of cleared land. In the
Ohio valley the Civil War found the farmer at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
ease; to the west and northwest we must set
the date further along. The conditions of this
intermediate period may not be overlooked in
any scrutiny of the farmer of these changed
and changing times. When the cloud of the
Civil War lifted and the West began asserting
itself in the industrial world, the farmer, viewing
the smoke-stacks that advertised the entrance
of the nearest towns and cities into manufacturing,
became a man with a grievance, who
bitterly reflected that when rumors of &#8220;good
times&#8221; reached him he saw no perceptible change
in his own fortunes or prospects, and in &#8220;bad
times&#8221; he felt himself the victim of hardship
and injustice. The glory of pioneering had
passed with his father and grandfather; they
had departed, leaving him without their incentive
of urgent necessity or the exultance of
conquest. There may have been some weakening
of the fibre, or perhaps it was only a lessening
of the tension now that the Indians had been
dispersed and the fear of wild beasts lifted from
his household.</p>

<p>There were always, of course, men who were
pointed to as prosperous, who for one reason
or another &#8220;got ahead&#8221; when others fell behind.
They not only held their acres free of
mortgage but added to their holdings. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
men were very often spoken of as &#8220;close,&#8221; or
tight-fisted; in Mr. Brand Whitlock&#8217;s phrase
they were &#8220;not rich, but they had money.&#8221;
And, having money and credit, they were sharply
differentiated from their neighbors who were
forever borrowing to cover a shortage. These
men loomed prominently in their counties;
they took pride in augmenting the farms inherited
from pioneer fathers; they might sit
in the State legislature or even in the national
Congress. But for many years the farmer was
firmly established in the mind of the rest of the
world as an object of commiseration. He occupied
an anomalous position in the industrial
economy. He was a landowner without enjoying
the dignity of a capitalist; he performed
the most arduous tasks without recognition by
organized labor. He was shabby, dull, and
uninteresting. He drove to town over a bad
road with a load of corn, and, after selling or
bartering it, negotiated for the renewal of his
mortgage and stood on the street corner, an
unheroic figure, until it was time to drive home.
He symbolized hard work, hard luck, and discouragement.
The saloon, the livery-stable,
and the grocery where he did his trading were
his only loafing-places. The hotel was inhospitable;
he spent no money there and the proprietor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
didn&#8217;t want &#8220;rubes&#8221; or &#8220;jays&#8221; hanging
about. The farmer and his wife ate their midday
meal in the farm-wagon or at a restaurant
on the &#8220;square&#8221; where the frugal patronage
of farm folk was not despised.</p>

<p>The type I am describing was often wasteful
and improvident. The fact that a degree of
mechanical skill was required for the care of
farm-machinery added to his perplexities; and
this apparatus he very likely left out-of-doors
all winter for lack of initiative to build a shed
to house it. I used to pass frequently a farm
where a series of reapers in various stages of
decrepitude decorated the barn-lot, with always
a new one to heighten the contrast.</p>

<p>The social life of the farmer centred chiefly
in the church, where on the Sabbath day he
met his neighbors and compared notes with
them on the state of the crops. Sundays on
the farm I recall as days of gloom that brought
an intensification of week-day homesickness.
The road was dusty; the church was hot; the
hymns were dolorously sung to the accompaniment
of a wheezy organ; the sermon was long,
strongly flavored with brimstone, and did
nothing to lighten</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>The horses outside stamped noisily in their
efforts to shake off the flies. A venturous bee
might invade the sanctuary and arouse hope
in impious youngsters of an attack upon the
parson&mdash;a hope never realized! The preacher&#8217;s
appetite alone was a matter for humor; I once
reported a Methodist conference at which the
succulence of the yellow-legged chickens in a
number of communities that contended for the
next convocation was debated for an hour.
The height of the country boy&#8217;s ambition was
to break a colt and own a side-bar buggy in
which to take a neighbor&#8217;s daughter for a drive
on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Community gatherings were rare; men lived
and died in the counties where they were born,
&#8220;having seen nothing, still unblest.&#8221; County
and State fairs offered annual diversion, and
the more ambitious farmers displayed their
hogs and cattle, or mammoth ears of corn, and
reverently placed their prize ribbons in the
family Bibles on the centre-tables of their sombre
parlors. Cheap side-shows and monstrosities,
horse-races and balloon ascensions were
provided for their delectation, as marking the
ultimate height of their intellectual interests.
A characteristic &#8220;Riley story&#8221; was of a farmer
with a boil on the back of his neck, who spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
a day at the State fair waiting for the balloon
ascension. He inquired repeatedly: &#8220;Has the
balloon gone up yit?&#8221; Of course when the
ascension took place he couldn&#8217;t lift his head
to see the balloon, but, satisfied that it really
had &#8220;gone up,&#8221; he contentedly left for home.
(It may be noted here that the new status of
the farmer is marked by an improvement in
the character of amusements offered by State-fair
managers. Most of the Western States
have added creditable exhibitions of paintings
to their attractions, and in Minnesota these
were last year the subject of lectures that proved
to be very popular.)</p>

<p>The farmer, in the years before he found
that he must become a scientist and a business
man to achieve success, was the prey of a great
variety of sharpers. Tumble-down barns bristled
with lightning-rods that cost more than
the structures were worth. A man who had
sold cooking-ranges to farmers once told me of
the delights of that occupation. A carload of
ranges would be shipped to a county-seat and
transferred to wagons. It was the agent&#8217;s game
to arrive at the home of a good &#8220;prospect&#8221;
shortly before noon, take down the old, ramshackle
cook-stove, set up the new and glittering
range, and assist the womenfolk to prepare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
a meal. The farmer, coming in from the fields
and finding his wife enchanted, would order a
range and sign notes for payment. These obligations,
after the county had been thoroughly
exploited, would be discounted at the local bank.
In this way the farmer&#8217;s wife got a convenient
range she would never have thought of buying
in town, and her husband paid an exorbitant
price for it.</p>

<p>The farmer&#8217;s wife was, in this period to which
I am referring, a poor drudge who appeared at
the back door of her town customers on Saturday
mornings with eggs and butter. She was
copartner with her husband, but, even though
she might have &#8220;brought&#8221; him additional acres
at marriage, her spending-money was limited
to the income from butter, eggs, and poultry,
and even this was dependent upon the generosity
of the head of the house. Her kitchen
was furnished with only the crudest housewifery
apparatus; labor-saving devices reached
her slowly. In busy seasons, when there were
farm-hands to cook for, she might borrow a
neighbor&#8217;s daughter to help her. Her only
relief came when her own daughters grew old
enough to assist in her labors. She was often
broken down, a prey to disease, before she
reached middle life. Her loneliness, the dreary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
monotony of her existence, the prevailing hopelessness
of never &#8220;catching up&#8221; with her sewing
and mending, often drove her insane. The
farmhouse itself was a desolate place. There
is a mustiness I associate with farmhouses&mdash;the
damp stuffiness of places never reached by
the sun. With all the fresh air in the world to
draw from, thousands of farmhouses were ill-lighted
and ill-ventilated, and farm sanitation
was of the most primitive order.</p>

<p class="caption">A typical old homestead of the Middle West.<br />

The farm on which Tecumseh was born.</p>

<p>I have dwelt upon the intermediate period
merely to heighten the contrast with the new
era&mdash;an era that finds the problem of farm
regeneration put squarely up to the farmer.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The new era really began with the passage
of the Morrill Act, approved July 2, 1862,
though it is only within a decade that the effects
of this law upon the efficiency and the
character of the farmer have been markedly
evident. The Morrill Act not only made the
first provision for wide-spread education in
agriculture but lighted the way for subsequent
legislation that resulted in the elevation of
the Department of Agriculture to a cabinet
bureau, the system of agriculture experiment-stations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the co-operation of federal and State
bureaus for the diffusion of scientific knowledge
pertaining to farming and the breeding and
care of live-stock, and the recent introduction of
vocational training into country schools.</p>



<p>It was fitting that Abraham Lincoln, who had
known the hardest farm labor, should have
signed a measure of so great importance, that
opened new possibilities to the American farmer.
The agricultural colleges established under his
Act are impressive monuments to Senator Morrill&#8217;s
far-sightedness. When the first land-grant
colleges were opened there was little upon which
to build courses of instruction. Farming was
not recognized as a science but was a form of
hard labor based on tradition and varied only
by reckless experiments that usually resulted in
failure. The first students of the agricultural
schools, drawn largely from the farm, were discouraged
by the elementary character of the
courses. Instruction in ploughing, to young
men who had learned to turn a straight furrow
as soon as they could tiptoe up to the plough-handles,
was not calculated to inspire respect
for &#8220;book farming&#8221; either in students or their
doubting parents.</p>

<p>The farmer and his household have found
themselves in recent years the object of embarrassing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
attentions not only from Washington,
the land-grant colleges, and the experiment-stations,
but countless private agencies have
&#8220;discovered&#8221; the farmer and addressed themselves
determinedly to the amelioration of his
hardships. The social surveyor, having analyzed
the city slum to his satisfaction, springs from
his automobile at the farmhouse door and
asks questions of the bewildered occupants that
rouse the direst apprehensions. Sanitarians
invade the premises and recommend the most
startling changes and improvements. Once it
was possible for typhoid or diphtheria to ravage
a household without any interference from the
outside world; now a health officer is speedily
on the premises to investigate the old oaken
bucket, the iron-bound bucket, that hangs in
the well, and he very likely ties and seals the
well-sweep and bids the farmer bore a new well,
in a spot kindly chosen for him, where the barn-lot
will not pollute his drinking-water. The
questionnaire, dear to the academic investigator,
is constantly in circulation. Women&#8217;s
clubs and federations thereof ponder the plight
of the farmer&#8217;s wife and are eager to hitch her
wagon to a star. Home-mission societies,
alarmed by reports of the decay of the country
church, have instituted surveys to determine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the truth of this matter. The consolidation of
schools, the introduction of comfortable omnibuses
to carry children to and from home, the
multiplication of country high schools, with a
radical revision of the curriculum, the building
of two-story schoolhouses in place of the old one-room
affair in which all branches were taught at
once, and the use of the schoolhouse as a community
centre&mdash;these changes have dealt a
blow to the long-established ideal of the red-mittened
country child, wading breast-high
through snow to acquaint himself with the three
R&#8217;s and, thus fortified, enter into the full enjoyment
of American democracy. Just how Jefferson
would look upon these changes and this benignant
paternalism I do not know, nor does it
matter now that American farm products are
reckoned in billions and we are told that the
amount must be increased or the world will
starve.</p>

<p>The farmer&#8217;s mail, once restricted to an occasional
letter, began to be augmented by other
remembrances from Washington than the hollyhock-seed
his congressman occasionally conferred
upon the farmer&#8217;s wife. Pamphlets in
great numbers poured in upon him, filled with
warnings and friendly counsel. The soil he
had sown and reaped for years, in the full confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
that he knew all its weaknesses and
possibilities, he found to be something very
different and called by strange names. His
lifelong submission to destructive worms and
hoppers was, he learned, unnecessary if not
criminal; there were ways of eliminating these
enemies, and he shyly discussed the subject
with his neighbors.</p>

<p>In speaking of the farmer&#8217;s shyness I have
stumbled into the field of psychology, whose
pitfalls are many. The psychologists have as
yet played their search-light upon the farm
guardedly or from the sociologist&#8217;s camp. I
here condense a few impressions merely that
the trained specialist may hasten to convict me
of error. The farmer of the Middle West&mdash;the
typical farmer with approximately a quarter-section
of land&mdash;is notably sensitive, timid,
only mildly curious, cautious, and enormously
suspicious. (&#8220;The farmer,&#8221; a Kansas friend
whispers, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t vote his opinions; he votes
his suspicions!&#8221;) In spite of the stuffing of his
rural-route box with instructive literature designed
to increase the productiveness of his
acres and lighten his own toil, he met the first
overtures of the &#8220;book-l&#8217;arnin&#8217;&#8221; specialist
warily, and often with open hostility. The
reluctant earth has communicated to the farmer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
perhaps in all times and in all lands, something
of its own stubbornness. He does not like to
be driven; he is restive under criticism. The
county agent of the extension bureau who seeks
him out with the best intentions in the world,
to counsel him in his perplexities, must approach
him diplomatically. I find in the report
of a State director of agricultural extension
a discreet statement that &#8220;the forces of
this department are organized, not for purposes
of dictation in agricultural matters but for
service and assistance in working out problems
pertaining to the farm and the community.&#8221;
The farmer, unaffected as he is by crowd psychology,
is not easily disturbed by the great
movements and tremendous crises that rouse
the urban citizen. He reads his newspaper
perhaps more thoroughly than the city man,
at least in the winter season when the distractions
of the city are greatest and farm duties
are the least exacting. Surrounded by the
peace of the fields, he is not swayed by mighty
events, as men are who scan the day&#8217;s news on
trains and trolleys and catch the hurried comments
of their fellow citizens as they plunge
through jostling throngs. Professor C. J. Galpin,
of Wisconsin University, aptly observes
that, while the farmer trades in a village, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
shares the invisible government of a township,
which &#8220;scatters and mystifies&#8221; his community
sense.</p>

<p>It was a matter of serious complaint that
farmers responded very slowly in the first
Liberty Loan campaigns. At the second call
vigorous attempts were made through the corn
belt to rouse the farmer, who had profited so
enormously by the war&#8217;s augmentation of prices.
In many cases country banks took the minimum
allotment of their communities and then sent
for the farmers to come in and subscribe. The
Third Loan, however, was met in a much better
spirit. The farmer is unused to the methods
by which money-raising &#8220;drives&#8221; are conducted
and he resents being told that he must do this,
that, or the other thing. Townfolk are beset
constantly by demands for money for innumerable
causes; there is always a church, a hospital,
a social-service house, a Y. M. C. A. building,
or some home or refuge for which a special
appeal is being made. There is a distinct psychology
of generosity based largely on the inspiration
of thoroughly organized effort, where
teams set forth with a definite quota to &#8220;raise&#8221;
before a fixed hour, but the farmer was long
immune from these influences.</p>

<p>In marked contrast with the small farmer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
who wrests a scant livelihood from the soil, is
his neighbor who boasts a section or a thousand
acres, who is able to utilize the newest machinery
and to avail himself of the latest disclosures
of the laboratories, to increase his
profits. One visits these large farms with admiration
for the fruitful land, the perfect equipment,
the efficient method, and the alert, wide-awake
owner. He lives in a comfortable house,
often electric-lighted and &#8220;plumbed,&#8221; visits the
cities, attends farm conferences, and is keenly
alive to the trend of public affairs. If the frost
nips his corn he is aware of every means by
which &#8220;soft&#8221; corn may be handled to the best
advantage. He knows how many cattle and
hogs his own acres will feed, and is ready with
cash to buy his neighbors&#8217; corn and feed it to
stock he buys at just the right turn of the
market. It is possible for a man to support
himself and a family on eighty acres; I have
talked with men who have done this; but they
&#8220;just about get by.&#8221; The owner of a big farm,
whose modern house and rich demesne are admired
by the traveller, is a valued customer of
a town or city banker; the important men of
his State cultivate his acquaintance, with resulting
benefits in a broader outlook than his
less-favored neighbors enjoy. Farmers of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
class are themselves usually money-lenders or
shareholders in country banks, and they watch
the trend of affairs from the view-point of the
urban business man. They live closer to the
world&#8217;s currents and are more accessible and
responsive to appeals of every sort than their
less-favored brethren.</p>

<p>But it is the small farmer, the man with the
quarter-section or less, who is the special focus
of the search-light of educator, scientist, and
sociologist. During what I have called the intermediate
period&mdash;the winter of the farmer&#8217;s
discontent&mdash;the politicians did not wholly ignore
him. The demagogue went forth in every
campaign with special appeals to the honest
husbandman, with the unhappy effect of driving
the farmer more closely into himself and
strengthening his class sense. For the reason
that the security of a democracy rests upon
the effacement to the vanishing-point of class
feeling, and the establishment of a solidarity
of interests based upon a common aim and
aspiration, the effort making to dignify farming
as a calling and quicken the social instincts
of the farmer&#8217;s household are matters of national
importance.</p>

<p>It may be said that in no other business is
there a mechanism so thoroughly organized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
for guarding the investor from errors of omission
or commission. I am aware of no &#8220;service&#8221;
in any other field of endeavor so excellent
as that of the agricultural colleges and their
auxiliary experiment and extension branches,
and it is a pleasure to testify to the ease with
which information touching the farm in all
its departments may be collected. Only the
obtuse may fail these days to profit by the
newest ideas in soil-conservation, plant-nutrition,
animal-husbandry, and a thousand other
subjects of vital importance to the farmer. To
test the &#8220;service&#8221; I wrote to the Department
of Agriculture for information touching a number
of subjects in which my ignorance was profound.
The return mail brought an astonishing array
of documents covering all my inquiries and
other literature which my na&iuml;ve questions had
suggested to the Department as likely to prove
illuminative. As the extent of the government&#8217;s
aid to the farmer and stockman is known
only vaguely to most laymen, I shall set down

<p>As most of these bulletins may be had free
and for others only a nominal price of five or
ten cents is charged, it is possible to accumulate
an extensive library with a very small expenditure.
Soil-fertilization alone is the subject
of an enormous literature; the field investigator
and the laboratory expert have subjected the
earth in every part of America to intensive
study and their reports are presented clearly
and with a minimum use of technical terms.
Many manufacturers of implements or materials
used on farms publish and distribute
books of real dignity in the advertisement of
their wares. I have before me a handsome
volume, elaborately illustrated, put forth by
a Wisconsin concern, describing the proper
method of constructing and equipping a dairy-barn.

that the manger so alluringly offered really

to an immediate investment in a herd merely
for the joy of housing it in the attractive manner

<p>Agricultural schools and State extension bureaus
manifest the greatest eagerness to serve
the earnest seeker for enlightenment. &#8220;The
Service of YOUR College Brought as Near as
Your Mail-Box,&#8221; is the slogan of the Kansas
State Agricultural College. Once upon a time
I sought the answer to a problem in Egyptian
hieroglyphics and learned that the only American
who could speak authoritatively on that
particular point was somewhere on the Nile
with an exploration party. In the field of agriculture
there is no such paucity of scholarship.
The very stupidity of a question seems to awaken
pity in the intelligent, accommodating persons
who are laboring in the farmer&#8217;s behalf. Augustine
Birrell remarks that in the days of the
tractarian movement pamphlets were served
upon the innocent bystander like sheriffs&#8217; processes.
In like manner one who manifests only
the tamest curiosity touching agriculture in
any of its phases will find literature pouring in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
upon him; and he is distressed to find that it
is all so charmingly presented that he is beguiled
into reading it!</p>

<p>The charge that the agricultural school is
educating students away from the farm is not
substantiated by reports from representative
institutions of this character. The dean of
the College of Agriculture of the University of
Illinois, Dr. Eugene Davenport, has prepared
a statement illustrative of the sources from
which the students of that institution are derived.
Every county except two is represented
in the agricultural department in a registration
of 1,200 students, and, of 710 questioned, 242
are from farms; 40 from towns under 1,000;
87 from towns of 1,000 to 1,500; 262 from towns
of 5,000 and up; and 79 from Chicago. Since
1900 nearly 1,000 students have completed the
agricultural course in this institution, and of this
number 69 per cent are actually living on farms
and engaged in farming; 17 per cent are teaching
agriculture, or are engaged in extension work;
10 per cent entered callings related to farming,
such as veterinary surgery, landscape-gardening,
creamery-management, etc.; less than 4 per
cent are in occupations not allied with agriculture.
It should be explained that the Illinois
school had only a nominal existence until seventeen
years ago. The number of students has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
steadily increased from 7 registrations in 1890
to 1,201 in 1916-17. At the Ohio College of
Agriculture half the freshman classes of the last
three years came from the cities, though this
includes students in landscape architecture and
horticulture. In Iowa State College the reports
of three years show that 54.5 per cent of the
freshmen were sons of farmers, and of the graduates
of a seven-year period (1907-1914) 34.8 are
now engaged in farming.</p>

<p>The opportunities open to the graduates of
these colleges have been greatly multiplied by
the demand for teachers in vocational schools,
and the employment of county agents who
must be graduates of a school of agriculture or
have had the equivalent in practical farm experience.
The influence of the educated farmer
upon his neighbors is very marked. They may
view his methods with distrust, but when he
rolls up a yield of corn that sets a new record
for fields with which they are familiar they
cannot ignore the fact that, after all, there may
be something in the idea of school-taught farming.
By the time a farm boy enters college he
is sufficiently schooled in his father&#8217;s methods,
and well enough acquainted with the home
acres, to appreciate fully the value of the instruction
the college offers him.</p>

<p>The only difference between agricultural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
colleges and other technical schools is that to
an unscientific observer the courses in agronomy
and its co-ordinate branches deal with vital
matters that are more interesting and appealing
than those in, let us say, mechanical engineering.
If there is something that stirs the
imagination in the thought that two blades of
grass may be made to grow where only one
had grown before, how much more satisfying
is the assurance that an acre of soil, properly
fertilized and thoroughly tended, may double
its yield of corn; that there is a choice well
worth the knowing between breeds of beef or
dairy cattle, and that there is a demonstrable
difference in the energy of foods that may be
converted into pork, particularly when there is
a shortage and the government, to stimulate
hog production, fixes a minimum price (November,
1917) of $15.50 per hundredweight in the
Chicago market; and even so stabilized the
price is close upon $20 in July, 1918.</p>

the representative breeds. Last fall I spent
two days in the agricultural school of a typical
land-grant college of the corn belt (Purdue University),
and found the experience wholly edifying.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
The value of this school to the State of
Indiana is incalculable. Here the co-ordinate
extension service under Professor G. I. Christie
is thoroughly systematized, and reaches every
acre of land in the commonwealth. &#8220;Send for
Christie&#8221; has become a watchword among
Indiana farmers in hours of doubt or peril.
Christie can diagnose an individual farmer&#8217;s
troubles in the midst of a stubborn field, and
fully satisfy the landowner as to the merit of
the prescribed remedy; or he can interest a
fashionable city audience in farm problems.
He was summoned to Washington a year ago
to supervise farm-labor activities, and is a member
of the recently organized war policies board.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
The extension service in all the corn and wheat
States is excellent; it must be in capable hands,
for the farmer at once becomes suspicious if the
State agent doesn&#8217;t show immediately that he
knows his business.</p>

<p>The students at Purdue struck me as more
attentive and alert than those I have observed
from time to time in literature classes of schools
that stick to the humanities. In an entomology
class, where I noted the presence of one
young woman, attention was riveted upon
a certain malevolent grasshopper, the foe of
vegetation and in these years of anxious conservation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
an enemy of civilization. That a
young woman should elect a full course in
agronomy and allied branches seemed to me
highly interesting, and, to learn her habitat in
the most delicate manner possible, I asked for
a census of the class, to determine how many
students were of farm origin. The young lady
so deeply absorbed in the grasshopper was, I
found, a city girl. Women, it should be noted,
are often very successful farmers and stock-breeders.
They may be seen at all representative
cattle-shows inspecting the exhibits with sophistication
and pencilling notes in the catalogues.</p>

<p>To sit in the pavilion of one of these colleges
and hear a lecture on the judging of cattle is
to be persuaded that much philosophy goes
into the production of a tender, juicy beefsteak
or a sound, productive milch cow. In a class
that I visited a Polled Angus steer and a shorthorn
were on exhibition; the instructor might
have been a sculptor, conducting a class in
modelling, from the nice points of &#8220;line,&#8221; the
distribution of muscle and fat, that he dilated
upon. He invited questions, which led to a
discussion in which the whole class participated.
At the conclusion of this lecture a drove of
swine was driven in that a number of young
gentlemen might practise the fine art of &#8220;judging&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
this species against an approaching competitive
meeting with a class from another
school. In these days of multiplying farm-implements
and tractors, the farmer is driven perforce
to know something of mechanics. Time is
precious and the breaking down of a harvester
may be calamitous if the owner must send to
town for some one to repair it. These matters
are cared for in the farm-mechanics laboratories
where instruction is offered in the care, adjustment,
and repair of all kinds of farm-machinery.
While in the summer of 1917 only 40,000 tractors
were in use on American farms, it is estimated
that by the end of the current year the
number will have increased to 200,000, greatly
minimizing the shortage in men and horses.
The substitution of gasolene for horse-power is
only one of the many changes in farm methods
attributable to the imperative demand for
increased production of foodstuffs. Whitman
may have foreseen the coming of the tractor
when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Well-pleased America, thou beholdest,</div>
<div class="verse">Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters;</div>
<div class="verse">The human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements&#8221;;</div>
</div></div>

<p>for &#8220;crawling monster&#8221; happily describes the
tractor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>The anxiety to serve, to accommodate the
instruction to special needs, is illustrated in
the length of courses offered, which include a
week&#8217;s intensive course in midwinter designed
for farmers, two-year and four-year courses,
and post-graduate work. Men well advanced
in years attend the midwinter sessions, eager
to improve their methods in a business they
have followed all their lives. They often bring
their wives with them, to attend classes in dairying,
poultry-raising, or home economics. It is
significant of the new movement in farming
that at the University of Wisconsin, an institution
whose services to American agriculture
are inestimable, there is a course in agricultural
journalism, &#8220;intended,&#8221; the catalogue recites,
&#8220;to be of special service to students who will
engage in farming or who expect to be employed
in station work or in some form of demonstration
or extension service and who therefore may
have occasion to write for publication and certainly
will have farm produce and products
to sell. To these ends the work is very largely
confined to studies in agricultural writing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The easing of the farmer&#8217;s burdens, through
the development of labor-saving machinery,
and the convenience of telephones, trolley-lines,
and the cheap automobile that have vastly
improved his social prospects, has not overcome
a growing prejudice against close kinship
with the soil. We have still to deal with the
loneliness and the social barrenness that have
driven thousands of the children of farms to
the cities. The son of a small farmer may make
a brilliant record in an agricultural college,
achieve the distinction of admission to the
national honorary agricultural fraternity (the
Alpha Zeta, the little brother of the Phi Beta
Kappa), and still find the old home crippling
and stifling to his awakened social sense.</p>

<p>There is general agreement among the authorities
that one of the chief difficulties in
the way of improvement is the lack of leadership
in farm communities. The farmer is not
easily aroused, and he is disposed to resent as
an unwarranted infringement upon his constitutional
rights the attempts of outsiders to
meddle with his domestic affairs. He has found
that it is profitable to attend institutes, consult
county agents, and peruse the literature distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
from extension centres, but the invasion
of his house is a very different matter.
Is he not the lord of his acres, an independent,
self-respecting citizen, asking no favors of society?
Does he not ponder well his civic duty
and plot the destruction of the accursed middleman,
his arch-enemy? The benevolently inclined
who seek him out to persuade him of
the error of his ways in any particular are often
received with scant courtesy. He must be
&#8220;shown,&#8221; not merely &#8220;told.&#8221; The agencies
now so diligently at work to improve the farmer&#8217;s
social status understand this and the methods
employed are wisely tempered in the light of
abundant knowledge of just how much crowding
the farmer will stand.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_120.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A feeding-plant at &#8220;Whitehall,&#8221; the farm of Edwin S. Kelly, near<br />
Springfield, Ohio.</p>

<p>Nothing is so essential to his success as the
health of his household; yet inquiries, more
particularly in the older States of the Mississippi
valley, lead to the conclusion that there
is a dismaying amount of chronic invalidism on
farms. A physician who is very familiar with
farm life declares that &#8220;all farmers have stomach
trouble,&#8221; and this obvious exaggeration is rather
supported by Dr. John N. Hurty, secretary of
the Indiana State Board of Health, who says
that he finds in his visits to farmhouses that
the cupboards are filled with nostrums warranted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
to relieve the agonies of poor digestion.
Dr. Hurty, who has probably saved more lives
and caused more indignation in his twenty
years of public service than any other Hoosier,
has made a sanitary survey of four widely separated
Indiana counties. In Blackford County,
where 1,374 properties were inspected, only 15
per cent of the farmhouses were found to be
sanitary. Site, ventilation, water-supply, the
condition of the house, and the health of its
inmates entered into the scoring. In Ohio
County, where 441 homes were visited, 86 per
cent were found to be insanitary. The tuberculosis
rate for this county was found to be 25
per cent higher than that of the State. In
Scott County 97.6 per cent of the farms were
pronounced insanitary, and here the tuberculosis
rate is 48.3 per cent higher than that of the
State. In Union County, where only 2.3 per
cent of the farms were found to be sanitary, the
average score did not rise above 45 per cent on
site, ventilation, and health. Here the tuberculosis
death-rate was 176.3 in 100,000, against
the State rate of 157. In all these counties the
school population showed a decrease.</p>

<p>It should be said that in the communities
mentioned, old ones as history runs in this
region, many homes stand practically unaltered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
after fifty or seventy-five years of continuous
occupancy. Thousands of farmers who would
think it a shameless extravagance to install a
bathtub boast an automobile. A survey by
Professor George H. von Tungeln, of Iowa
College, of 227 farms in two townships of
northern Iowa, disclosed 62 bathtubs, 98
pianos, and 124 automobiles. The number of
bathtubs reported by the farmers of Ohio is
so small that I shrink from stating it.</p>

<p>Here, again, we may be sure that the farmer
is not allowed to dwell in slothful indifference
to the perils of uncleanliness. On the heels of
the sanitarian and the sociologist come the
field agents of the home-economics departments
of the meddlesome land-grant colleges,
bent upon showing him a better way of life.
I was pondering the plight of the bathless farmhouse
when a document reached me showing
how a farmhouse may enjoy running water,
bathroom, gas, furnace, and two fireplaces for
an expenditure of $723.97. One concrete story
is better than many treatises, and I cheerfully
cite, as my authority, &#8220;Modernizing an Old
Farm House,&#8221; by Mrs. F. F. Showers, included
among the publications of the Wisconsin College
of Agriculture. The home-economics departments
do not wait for the daughters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the farm to come to them, but seek them out
with the glad tidings that greater ease and comfort
are within their reach if only their fathers
can be made to see the light. In many States
the extension agents organize companies of
countrywomen and carry them junketing to
modern farmhouses.</p>

<p>Turning to Nebraska, whose rolling cornfields
are among the noblest to be encountered
anywhere, home-demonstration agents range
the commonwealth organizing clubs, which are
federated where possible to widen social contacts,
better-babies conferences, and child-welfare
exhibits. The Community Welfare Assembly,
as conducted in Kansas, has the merit
of offering a varied programme&mdash;lectures on
agriculture and home economics, civics, health,
and rural education by specialists, moving pictures,
community music, and folk games and
stories for the children. In Wisconsin the rural-club
movement reaches every part of the State,
and a State law grants the use of schoolhouses
for community gatherings. Seymour, Indiana,
boasts a Farmer&#8217;s Club, the gift of a citizen,
with a comfortably appointed house, where
farmers and their families may take their ease
when in town.</p>

<p>The organization of boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; clubs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
among farm youth is a feature of the vocational-training
service offered under the Smith-Lever
Act of 1914, and already the reports of its progress
are highly interesting. These organizations
make possible the immediate application
of the instruction in agriculture and home economics
received in the schools. In Indiana
more than 25,000 boys and girls were enlisted
last year in such club projects as the cultivation
of corn, potatoes, and garden vegetables, canning,
sewing, and home-craft, and the net profit
from these sources was $105,100. In my prowlings
nothing has delighted me more than the
discovery of the Pig Club. This is one of Uncle
Sam&#8217;s many schemes for developing the initiative
and stimulating the ambition of farm children.
It might occur to the city boy, whose acquaintance
with pork is limited to his breakfast
bacon, that the feeding of a pig is not a matter
worthy of the consideration of youth of intelligence
and aspiration. Uncle Sam, however,
holds the contrary opinion. From a desk in
the Department of Agriculture he has thrown
a rosy glamour about the lowly pig. Country
bankers, properly approached and satisfied of
the good character and honorable intentions
of applicants, will advance money to farm boys
to launch them upon pig-feeding careers. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
heart warms to Douglas Byrne, of Harrison
County, Indiana, who, under the guidance of a
club supervisor, fed 17 hogs with a profit of
$99.30. Another young Hoosier, Elmer Pearce,
of Vanderburgh County, fed 2 pigs that made a
daily gain of 1.38 pounds for four months, and
sold them at a profit of $12.36. We learn from
the official report that this young man&#8217;s father
warned him that the hogs he exercised his talents
upon would make no such gains as were
achieved. Instead of spanking the lad for his
perverseness, as would have been the case in
the olden golden days, this father made him the
ruler over 30 swine. There are calf and pig
clubs for girls, and a record has been set for
Indiana by twelve-year-old Pauline Hadley, of
Mooresville, who cared for a Poland China hog
for 110 days, increasing its weight from 65 to
256 pounds, and sold it at a profit of $20.08.</p>

<p>The farmer of yesterday blundered through
a year and at the end had a very imperfect idea
of his profits and losses. He kept no accounts;
if he paid his taxes and the interest on the omnipresent
mortgage, and established credit for
the winter with his grocer, he was satisfied.
Uncle Sam, thoroughly aroused to the importance
of increasing the farmer&#8217;s efficiency, now
shows him how to keep simple accounts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
returns at the end of the season to analyze
the results. (Farm-management is the subject
of many beguiling pamphlets; it seems incredible
that any farmer should blindly go on
wasting time and money when his every weakness
is anticipated and prescribed for by the
Department of Agriculture and its great army
of investigators and counsellors!)</p>

<p>If there is little cheerful fiction dealing with
farm life, its absence is compensated for by the
abundance of &#8220;true stories&#8221; of the most stimulating
character, to be found in the publications
of the State agricultural extension bureaus.
Professor Christie&#8217;s report of the Indiana
Extension Service for last year recites the result
of three years&#8217; observation of a southern
Indiana farm of 213 acres. In 1914 the owner
cleared $427 above interest on his capital, in
addition to his living. This, however, was
better than the average for the community,
which was a cash return of $153. This man
had nearly twice as much land as his neighbors,
carried more live-stock, and his crop yields
were twice as great as the community average.
His attention was called to the fact that he
was investing $100 worth of feed and getting
back only $82 in his live-stock account. He
was expending 780 days in the care of his farm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
and stock, which the average corn-belt farmer
could have managed with 605 days of labor.
Acting on the advice of the Extension Department,
he added to his live-stock, built a silo,
changed his feeding ration, and increased his
live-stock receipts to $154 per $100 of feed.
The care of the additional live-stock through
the winter resulted in a better reward for his
labor and the amount accredited to labor income
for the year was $1,505. The third year
he increased his live-stock and poultry, further
improved the feeding ration, and received $205
per $100 of feed. By adding to the conveniences
of his barn, he was able to cut down his expenditure
for hired labor; or, to give the exact
figures, he reduced the amount expended in
this way from $515 to $175. His labor income
for the third year was $3,451. &#8220;Labor income,&#8221;
as the phrase is employed in farm bookkeeping,
is the net sum remaining after the farm-owner
has paid all business expenses of the farm and
deducted a fair interest on the amount invested
in his plant.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the 80-acre farm as affording
a living for a family; but there is no ignoring
the testimony of farm-management surveys,
covering a wide area, that this unit is too small
to yield the owner the best results from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
labor. In a Nebraska survey it is demonstrated
that farms of from 200 to 250 acres
show better average returns than those of larger
or smaller groups, but rainfall, soil conditions,
and the farmer&#8217;s personal qualifications are
factors in all such studies that make generalizations
difficult. A diversified farm of 160 acres
requires approximately 3,000 hours&#8217; labor a
year. Forty-five acres of corn, shocked and
husked, consume 270 days of labor; like acreages
of oats and clover, 90 and 45 days respectively;
care of live-stock and poultry, 195 days.
In summer a farmer often works twelve or fourteen
hours a day, while in winter, with only
his stock to look after, his labor is reduced to
three or four hours.</p>

<p>The Smith-Hughes Act (approved February,
1917) appropriates annually sums which will
attain, in 1926, a maximum of $3,000,000 &#8220;for
co-operation with the States in the promotion
of education in agriculture and the trades and
industries, and in the preparation of teachers
of vocational subjects, the sums to be allotted
to the States in the proportion which their rural
population bears to the total rural population
of the United States.&#8221; Washington is only
the dynamic centre of inspiration and energy
in the application of the laws that make so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
generous provision for the farmer&#8217;s welfare.
The States must enter into a contract to defray
their share of the expense and put the
processes into operation.</p>

<p>There was something of prophecy in the
message of President Roosevelt (February 9,
1909) transmitting to Congress the report of
his Country Life Commission. He said: &#8220;Upon
the development of country life rests ultimately
our ability, by methods of farming requiring
the highest intelligence, to continue to feed
and clothe the hungry nations; to supply the
city with fresh blood, clean bodies, and clear
brains that can endure the terrific strain of
modern life; we need the development of men
in the open country, who will be in the future,
as in the past, the stay and strength of the nation
in time of war, and its guiding and controlling
spirit in time of peace.&#8221; The far-reaching
effect of the report, a remarkably thorough
and searching study of farm conditions, is perceptible
in agencies and movements that were
either suggested by it or that were strengthened
by its authoritative utterances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Much has been written of the decline of
religion in rural communities, and melancholy
statistics have been adduced as to the abandonment
of churches. But here, as in the matter
of farm efficiency and kindred rural problems,
vigorous attempts are making to improve conditions.
&#8220;The great spiritual needs of the country
community just at present are higher personal
and community ideals,&#8221; the Country Life
Commission reported. &#8220;Rural people have
need to have an aspiration for the highest possible
development of the community. There
must be an ambition on the part of the people
themselves constantly to progress in all those
things that make the community life wholesome,
satisfying, educative, and complete.
There must be a desire to develop a permanent
environment for the country boy and girl, of
which they will become passionately fond. As
a pure matter of education, the countryman
must learn to love the country and to have an
intellectual appreciation of it.&#8221; In this connection
I wish that every farm boy and girl in
America might read &#8220;The Holy Earth,&#8221; by
L. H. Bailey (a member of the commission), a
book informed with a singular sweetness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
nobility, and fit to be established as an auxiliary
reading-book in every agricultural college in
America.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence that the religious
bodies are not indifferent to the importance of
vitalizing the country church, and here the general
socializing movement is acting as a stimulus.
Not only have the churches, in federal and
State conferences, set themselves determinedly
to improve the rural parish, but the matter has
been the subject of much discussion by educational
and sociological societies with encouraging
gains. The wide-spread movement for the
consolidation of country schools suggests inevitably
the combination of country parishes,
assuring greater stability and making possible
the employment of permanent ministers of a
higher intellectual type, capable of exercising
that intelligent local leadership which all commentators
on the future of the farm agree is
essential to progress.</p>

<p>By whatever avenue the rural problem is approached
it is apparent that it is not sufficient
to persuade American youth of the economic
advantages of farming over urban employments,
but that the new generation must be convinced
in very concrete ways that country life affords
generous opportunities for comfort and happiness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
and that there are compensations for all
it lacks. The farmer of yesterday, strongly individualistic
and feeling that the world&#8217;s rough
hand was lifted against him, has no longer an
excuse for holding aloof from the countless
forces that are attempting to aid him and give
his children a better chance in life. No other
figure in the American social picture is receiving
so much attention as the farmer. A great
treasure of money is expended annually by
State and federal governments to increase his
income, lessen his labor, educate his children,
and bring health and comfort to his home. If
he fails to take advantage of the vast machinery
that is at work in his behalf, it is his own fault;
if his children do not profit by the labors of
the State to educate them, the sin is at his own
door. In his business perplexities he has but
to telephone to a county agent or to the extension
headquarters of his State to receive
the friendly counsel of an expert. If his children
are dissatisfied and long for variety and
change, it is because he has concealed from
them the means by which their lives may be
quickened and brightened.</p>

<p class="caption">Judging graded shorthorn herds at the American Royal Live Stock Show<br />
in Kansas City.</p>

<p>With the greatest self-denial I refrain from
concluding this chapter with a ringing peroration
in glorification of farm life. From a desk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
on the fifteenth floor of an office-building, with
an outlook across a smoky, clanging industrial
city, I could do this comfortably and with an
easy conscience. But the scientist has stolen
farming away from the sentimentalist and the
theorist. Farming, I may repeat, is a business,
the oldest and the newest in the world. No
year passes in which its methods and processes
are not carried nearer to perfection. City boys
now about to choose a vocation will do well to
visit an agricultural college and extension plant,
or, better still, a representative corn-belt farm,
before making the momentous decision. Perhaps
the thousands of urban lads who this year
volunteered to aid the farmers as a patriotic
service will be persuaded that the soil affords
opportunities not lightly to be passed by. No
one can foretell the vast changes that will be
precipitated when the mighty war is ended; but
one point is undebatable: the world, no matter
how low its fortunes may sink, must have bread
and meat. Tremendous changes and readjustments
are already foreshadowed; but in all
speculations the productiveness of the American
farm will continue to be a factor of enormous
importance.</p>

<p>A wide-spread absorption of land by large
investors, the increase of tenantry, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
passing of the farm family are possibilities of
the future not to be overlooked by those who
have at heart the fullest and soundest development
of American democracy. For every 100
acres of American land now under cultivation
there are about 375 acres untilled but susceptible
of cultivation. Here is a chance for American
boys of the best fibre to elect a calling that
more and more demands trained intelligence.
All things considered, the rewards of farming
average higher than those in any other occupation,
and the ambitious youth, touched with the
new American passion for service, for a more
perfect realization of the promise of democracy,
will find in rural communities a fallow field
ready to his hand.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A FATEFUL Titan, brooding over a mammoth
chess-board, now cautious in his
moves as he shifts his myriad pigmies,
now daring, but always resolute, clear-eyed,
steady of hand, and with no thought but victory&mdash;as
such a figure Rodin might have

<p>Chicago is not a baby and utters no bleating
cry that it is &#8220;misunderstood,&#8221; and yet a great

misinterpreted it but have expressed their dislike

Chicago may not be comprehended in the usual

laboring and aspiring and illustrating the

awakens at once the beholder&#8217;s sympathetic
interest. Chicago is not New York, nor is it
London or Paris: Chicago is different. The
Chicagoan will convince you of this if you fail
to see it; the point has been conceded by a
great number of observers from all quarters,
but not in just the same spirit in which the citizen
speaks of it.</p>

<p>Both inspired and uninspired critics have
made Chicago the subject of a considerable
literature that runs the gamut of anxious concern,
dismal apprehension, dismay, and disgust.
Mr. Kipling saw the city embodied as a
girl arrayed in a costume of red and black, shod
in red shoes sauntering jauntily down the gory
aisle of a slaughter-house. Mr. H. G. Wells
boasts that he refrained from visiting the packing-houses
owing to what he describes as his
immense &#8220;repugnance to the killing of fixed
and helpless animals.&#8221; He reports that he saw
nothing of those &#8220;ill-managed, ill-inspected
establishments,&#8221; though he &#8220;smelt the unwholesome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
reek from them over and over again,&#8221;
and observed with trepidation &#8220;the enormous
expanse and intricacy of railroads that net this
great industrial desolation.&#8221; Chicago&#8217;s pressing
need, he philosophizes, is discipline&mdash;a
panacea which he generously prescribes not
only for all that displeased him in America, but
for Lancashire, South and East London, and
the Pas de Calais. &#8220;Each man,&#8221; he ruminates,
&#8220;is for himself, each enterprise; there is no
order, no prevision, no common and universal
plan.&#8221; I have cheerfully set down this last
statement to lighten my own burdens, for by
reversing it one may very happily express the
real truth about Chicago. Instead of the
&#8220;shoving unintelligent proceedings of under-bred
and morally obtuse men,&#8221; great numbers
of men and women of the highest intelligence
are constantly directing their talents toward
the amelioration of the very conditions that
grieved Mr. Wells.</p>

<p>Chicago may, to be sure, be dismissed in a
few brilliant phrases as the black pit of perdition,
the jumping-off place of the world; but to
the serious-minded American the effort making
there for the common uplift is too searching,
too intelligent, too sincere, for sneers. I fancy
that in view of events that have occurred in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Europe since his visit to America Mr. Wells
would be less likely to rest his case against Chicago
on the need of discipline alone. All that
discipline may do for a people had been achieved
by the Imperial German Government when
the Kaiser started for Paris in 1914; but subjection,
obedience, even a highly developed
efficiency are not the whole of the law and the
prophets. Justice and mercy are finer things,
and nothing in Chicago is more impressive or
encouraging than the stubborn purpose of many
citizens who are neither foolish nor ignorant to
win and establish these twain for the whole.
It is an unjust and ungenerous assumption that
Chicago is unaware of its needs and dangers,
or that from year to year no gains are made
in the attempt to fuse and enlighten the mass.
It is the greatest laboratory that democracy
has known. The very fact that so much effort
must go into experiment, that there are more
than two and a half million distinct units to
deal with, with a resulting confusion in needs
and aims, adds not merely to the perplexity
but to the fascination of the social and political
enigma. There is, quite definitely, a thing
called the Chicago spirit, a thing compounded
of energy, faith, and hope&mdash;and again energy!
Nor is the energy all spent upon the material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
and sordid, for the fine, arresting thing is the
tremendous vim this lusty young giant among
the world&#8217;s cities brings to the solution of its
problems&mdash;problems that deserve to be printed
in capitals out of respect for their immensity
and far-reaching importance to the national
life. Chicago does not walk around her problems,
but meets them squarely and manfully.
The heart of the inquirer is won by the perfect
candor with which the Chicagoan replies to
criticism; the critic is advised that for every
evil there is a remedy; indeed, that some agency
is at work on that particular thing at that particular
moment. This information is conveyed
with a smile that expresses Chicago&#8217;s faith and
hope&mdash;a smile that may be a little sad and
wistful&mdash;but the faith and the hope are inescapably
there.</p>

<p>Chicago is the industrial and financial clearing-house,
the inspirational centre of the arts,
and the playground for 50,000,000 people. The
pilgrim who lands on the lake shore with an
open mind and a fair understanding of what
America is all about&mdash;the unprejudiced traveller&mdash;is
immediately conscious that here, indeed,
is a veritable capital of democracy.</p>

<p>Every night three hundred or more sleeping-cars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
bear approximately 4,500 persons toward
this Western metropolis on journeys varying
from five to twelve hours in length. From innumerable
points it is a night&#8217;s run, and any
morning one may see these pilgrims pouring
out of the railway-stations, dispersing upon a
thousand errands, often concluded in time for
the return trip between six o&#8217;clock and midnight.
At times one wonders whether all the
citizens of the tributary provinces have not
gathered here at once, so great is the pressure
upon hotel space, so thronged the streets. The
sleeping-car holds no terrors for the Westerner.
He enjoys the friendship of the train-crews;
the porters&mdash;many of them veterans of the
service&mdash;call him by name and in addressing
them he avoids the generic &#8220;George,&#8221; which
the travelling salesman applies to all knights
of the whisk-broom, and greets them by their
true baptismal appellations of Joshua or Obadiah.
Mr. George Ade has threatened to organize
a &#8220;Society for the Prevention of the
Calling of Sleeping-Car Porters George&#8221;!</p>

<p>The professional or business man rises from
his meagre couch refreshed and keen for adventure
and, after a strenuous day, returns to
it and slumbers peacefully as he is hurled homeward.
The man from Sioux City or Saint Joe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
who spends a day here does not crawl into his
berth weary and depressed, but returns inspired
and cheered and determined to put more vim
into his business the next morning. On the
homeward trail, eating supper in company with
the neighbors he finds aboard, he dilates eloquently
upon the wonders of the city, upon its
enterprise, upon the heartiness with which its
business men meet their customers. Chicago
men work longer hours than their New York
brethren and take pride in their accessibility.
It is easier to get a hearing in high quarters in
any field of endeavor in Chicago than in New
York; there is less waiting in the anteroom,
and a better chance of being asked out for
lunch.</p>

<p>The West is proud of Chicago and loves it
with a passionate devotion. Nor is it the purpose
of these reflections to hint that this mighty
Mecca is unworthy of the adoration of the millions
who turn toward it in affection and reverence.
Chicago not only draws strength from
a vast territory but, through myriad agencies
and avenues, sends back a mighty power from
its huge dynamo. It is the big brother of all
lesser towns, throwing an arm about Davenport
and Indianapolis, Springfield and Columbus,
and manifesting a kindly tolerance toward St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Louis, Kansas City, Detroit, Minneapolis, and
Cleveland, whose growth and prosperity lift
them to a recognized and respected rivalry.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_142.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Chicago is the big brother of all lesser towns.</p>

<p>The intense loyalty of the Chicagoan to his
city is one of his most admirable characteristics
and the secret of his city&#8217;s greatness. He is
proud even of the Chicago climate, which offers
from time to time every variety of weather
known to meteorology and is capable of effecting
combinations utterly new to this most fascinating
of sciences. Chicago&#8217;s coldest day of
record was in 1872, when the minus registration
was 23; the hottest in 1901, when the mercury
rose to 103. Such excesses are followed by
contrition and repentance and days of ethereal
mildness. The lake serves as a funnel down
which roar icy blasts direct from the hyperboreans.
The wind cuts like a scythe of ice swung
by a giant. In summer the hot plains pour in
their burning heat; or, again, when it pleases the
weather-god to produce a humid condition, the
moisture-charged air is stifling. But a Chicagoan
does not mind the winter, which he declares to
be good for body and soul; and, as for the heat,
he maintains&mdash;and with a degree of truth to
sustain him&mdash;that the nights are always cool.
The throngs that gathered in Chicago for the
Republican and the Progressive conventions in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
June, 1916, were treated to a diversity of
weather, mostly bad. It was cold; it rained
hideously. There were dismal hours of waiting
for reports of the negotiations between the
two bodies of delegates in which the noblest
oratory failed to bring warmth and cheer.
Chicago did her worst that week, but without
serious impairment of her prestige as the greatest
convention city in the world. Every one said,
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this just like Chicago!&#8221; and inquired
the way to the nearest quinine.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Windy City&#8221; is a descriptive sobriquet.
There are not only cold winds and hot winds
of the greatest intensity, but there are innumerable
little gusts that spring up out of nowhere
for no other conceivable purpose than to deposit
dust or cinders in the human eye. There is a
gesture acquired by all Chicagoans&mdash;a familiar
bit of calisthenics essential to the preservation
of head-gear. If you see a man pursuing his
hat in a Chicago street you may be sure that
he is an outsider; the native knows by a kind
of prescience just when the fateful breeze is
coming, prepares for it, and is never caught
unawares. In like manner the local optic seems
to be impregnable to persistent attacks of the
omnipresent cinder. By what means the eyeball
of a visitor becomes the haven for flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
d&eacute;bris, while the native-born walks unscathed,
is beyond my philosophy. It must be that the
eye of the inhabitant is trained to resist these
malevolent assaults and that the sharp-edged
cinder spitefully awaits an opportunity to impinge
upon the defenseless optic of passing
pilgrims. The pall of smoke miraculously disappears
at times and the cinder abandons its
depredations. The sky may be as blue over
Chicago as anywhere else on earth. The lake
shimmers like silk and from brown, near shore,
runs away to the horizon through every tint
of blue and green and vague, elusive purples.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Chicago still retained, in the years of my
first acquaintance, something of the tang of
the wild onion which in the Indian vernacular
was responsible for its name. (I shudderingly
take refuge in this parenthesis to avoid collision
with etymological experts who have spent their
lives sherlocking the word&#8217;s origin. The genesis
of &#8220;Chicago&#8221; is a moot question, not likely to
be settled at this late day. Whether it meant
leek, polecat, skunkweed, or onion does not
greatly matter. I choose the wild onion from
the possibilities, for the highly unscientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
reason that it seems to me the most appropriate
and flavorsome of all accessible suggestions.)</p>

<p>In the early eighties one might stand by the
lakeside and be very conscious of a West beyond
that was still in a pioneer stage. At the
department headquarters of the army might
be met hardy campaigners against the Indians
of mountain and plain who were still a little
apprehensive that the telegraph might demand
orders for the movement of troops against hostile
red men along the vanishing frontiers. The
battle of Wounded Knee, in which 100 warriors
and 120 women and children were found dead
on the field (December 29, 1890), might almost
have been observed from a parlor-car window.
It may have been that on my visits I chanced
to touch circles dominated by Civil War
veterans, but great numbers of these diverted
their energies to peaceful channels in Chicago
at the end of the rebellion, and they gave color
to the city life. It was a part of the upbringing
of a mid-Western boy of my generation to reverence
the heroes of the sixties, and it was fitting
that in the land of Lincoln and in a State that
gave Grant a regiment and started him toward
immortality there should be frequent reunions
of veterans, and political assemblages and agitations
in which they figured, to encourage hero-worship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
in the young. Unforgettable among
the more distinguished of these Civil War veterans
was General John A. Logan, sometime
senator in Congress and Blaine&#8217;s running mate
in 1884. In life he was a gallant and winning
figure, and Saint Gaudens&#8217;s equestrian statue
in Grant Park preserves his memory in a city
that delighted to honor him.</p>

<p>Chicago&#8217;s attractions in those days included
summer engagements of Theodore Thomas&#8217;s
orchestra, preceding Mr. Thomas&#8217;s removal to
the city and the founding of the orchestra that
became his memorial. Concerts were given in
an exposition hall on the site now occupied
by the Art Institute, with railway-trains gayly
disporting on the lake side of the building. So
persistent is the association of ideas, that to
this day I never hear the Fifth Symphony or
the Tannh&auml;user Overture free of the rumble
and jar and screech of traffic. It was in keeping
with Chicago&#8217;s good-humored tolerance of the
incongruous and discordant in those years that
the scores of Beethoven and Wagner should be
punctuated by locomotive whistles, and that
<i>pianissimo</i> passages should be drowned in the
grinding of brakes.</p>

<p>At this period David Swing stood every Sunday
morning in Central Music Hall addressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
large audiences, and he looms importantly in
the Chicago of my earliest knowledge. Swing
was not only a fine classical scholar&mdash;he lectured
charmingly on the Greek poets&mdash;but
he preached a gospel that harmonized with the
hopeful and liberal Chicago spirit as it gathered
strength and sought the forms in which it has
later declared itself. He was not an orator in
the sense that Ingersoll and Beecher were; as
I remember, he always read his sermons or
addresses; but he was a strikingly individual
and magnetic person, whose fine cultivation
shone brilliantly in his discourses. In the retrospect
it seems flattering to the Chicago of
that time that it recognized and appreciated
his quality in spite of an unorthodoxy that had
caused his retirement from the formal ministry.</p>

<p>The third member of a trinity that lingers
agreeably in my memory is Eugene Field.
Journalism has known no more versatile genius,
and his column of &#8220;Sharps and Flats&#8221; in
the <i>Morning News</i> (later the <i>Record</i>) voiced the
Chicago of his day. Here indubitably was
the flavor of the original wild-onion beds of the
Jesuit chronicles! Field became an institution
quite as much as Thomas and Swing, and reached
an audience that ultimately embraced the whole
United States. The literary finish of his paragraphs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
their wide range of subject, their tone,
varying from kindly encouraging comment on
a new book of verse that had won his approval
to a mocking jibe at some politician, his hatred
of pretense, the plausibility of the hoaxes he
was constantly perpetrating, gave an infinite
zest to his department. The most devoted of
Chicagoans, he nevertheless laid a chastening
hand upon his fellow citizens. In an ironic
vein that was perhaps his best medium he would
hint at the community&#8217;s lack of culture, though
he would be the first to defend the city from
such assaults from without the walls. He prepared
the way for the coming of Edmund Clarence
Stedman with announcements of a series
of bizarre entertainments in the poet&#8217;s honor,
including a street parade in which the meat-packing
industry was to be elaborately represented.
He gave circulation to a story, purely
fanciful, that Joel Chandler Harris was born in
Africa, where his parents were missionaries,
thus accounting for &#8220;Uncle Remus&#8217;s&#8221; intimate
acquaintance with negro characters and folklore.
His devotion to journalism was such that
he preferred to publish his verses in his newspaper
rather than in magazines, often hoarding
them for weeks that he might fill a column with
poems and create the impression that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
all flung off as part of the day&#8217;s work, though,
as a matter of fact, they were the result of the
most painstaking labor. With his legs thrown
across a table he wrote, on a pad held in his
lap, the minute, perpendicular hand, with its
monkish rubrications, that gave distinction to
all his &#8220;copy.&#8221; Among other accomplishments
he was a capital recitationist and mimic. There
was no end to the variety of ways in which he
could interest and amuse a company. He was
so pre-eminently a social being that it was difficult
to understand how he produced so much
when he yielded so readily to any suggestion
to strike work for any enterprise that promised
diversion. I linger upon his name not because
of his talents merely but because he was in a
very true sense the protagonist of the city in
those years; a veritable <i>genius loci</i> who expressed
a Chicago, &#8220;wilful, young,&#8221; that was disposed
to stick its tongue in its cheek in the presence
of the most exalted gods.</p>

<p>My Chicago of the consulship of Plancus
was illuminated also by the National League
ball club, whose roster contained &#8220;names to
fill a Roman line&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Pop&#8221; Anson, Clarkson,
Williamson, Ryan, Pfeffer, and &#8220;Mike&#8221; Kelley.
Chicago displayed hatchments of woe on her
portals when Kelley was &#8220;sold to Boston&#8221; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
$10,000! In his biography of Field Mr. Slason
Thompson has preserved this characteristic
paragraph&mdash;only one of many in which the
wit, humorist, and poet paid tribute to Kelley&#8217;s
genius:</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin Harrison is a good, honest,
patriotic man, and we like him. But he never
stole second base in all his life and he could
not swat Mickey Welch&#8217;s down curves over
the left-field fence. Therefore, we say again,
as we have said many times before, that, much
as we revere Benjamin Harrison&#8217;s purity and
amiability, we cannot but accord the tribute
of our sincerest admiration to that paragon
of American manhood, Michael J. Kelley.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It must be said for Chicago that to the best
of her ability her iniquities are kept in the open;
she conceals nothing; it is all there for your
observation if you are disposed to pry into the
heart of the matter. The rectilinear system
of streets exposes the whole city to the sun&#8217;s
eye. One is struck by the great number of
foreign faces, and by faces that show a blending
of races&mdash;a step, perhaps, toward the evolution
of some new American type. On Michigan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Avenue, where on fair afternoons something of
the brilliant spectacle of Fifth Avenue is reproduced,
women in bright turbans, men in modifications
of their national garb&mdash;Syrians, Greeks,
Turks, Russians and what-not&mdash;are caught up
and hurried along in the crowd. In the shopping
centres of Wabash Avenue and State Street the
foreign element is present constantly, and even
since the war&#8217;s abatement of immigration these
potential citizens are daily in evidence in the
railway-stations. Yet one has nowhere the sense
of congestion that is so depressing in New York&#8217;s
East Side; the overcrowding is not so apparent
even where the conditions are the worst Chicago
has to offer.</p>

<p>My search for the picturesque had been disappointing
until, quite undirected, I stumbled
into Maxwell Street one winter morning and
found its Jewish market to my liking. The
&#8220;Ham Fair&#8221; in Paris is richer in antiquarian
loot, but Maxwell Street is enough; &#8217;twill serve!
Here we have squalor, perhaps, and yet a pretty
clean and a wholly orderly squalor. Innumerable
booths litter the sidewalks of this thoroughfare
between Halstead and Jefferson Streets,
and merchandise and customers overflow into
the streets until traffic is blocked. Fruits, vegetables,
meats, fowls, raiment of every kind are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
offered. Bushel-baskets are the ordained receptacle
for men&#8217;s hats. A fine leisure characterizes
the movements and informs the
methods of the cautious purchaser. Cages of
pigeons proudly surmounting coops of fowls
suggested that their elevation might be attributable
to some special sanctity or reservation
for sacrificial rites. A cynical policeman (I saw
but one guardian of the peace in the course of
three visits) rudely dispelled this illusion with
a hint that these birds, enjoying a free range of
the air, had doubtless been feloniously captured
for exposure to sale in the market-place&mdash;an
imputation upon the bearded keepers of the
bird bazaars that I reject with scorn. Negroes
occasionally cross the bounds of their own
quarter to shop among these children of the
Ghettos&mdash;I wonder whether by some instinctive
confidence in the good-will of a people who
like themselves do daily battle with the most
deeply planted of all prejudices.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_152.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The &#8220;Ham Fair&#8221; in Paris is richer in antiquarian loot,<br />
but Maxwell Street is enough; &#8217;twill serve!</p>

<p>Chicago is rich in types; human nature is
comprehensively represented with its best and
worst. It should be possible to find here, midway
of the seas, the typical American, but I
am mistrustful of my powers of selection in so
grave a matter. There are too many men observable
in office-buildings and in clubs who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
might pass as typical New Yorkers if they were
encountered in Fifth Avenue, to make possible
any safe choice for the artist&#8217;s pencil. There is
no denying that the average Chicagoan is less
&#8220;smart&#8221; than the New Yorker. The pressing
of clothes and nice differentiations in haberdashery
seem to be less important to the male
here than to his New York cousin. I spent an
anxious Sunday morning in quest of the silk
hat, and reviewed the departing worshippers in
the neighborhood of many temples in this search,
but the only toppers I found were the crowning
embellishments of two colored gentlemen in
South State Street.</p>

<p>Perhaps the typical Chicagoan is the commuter
who, after the day&#8217;s hurry and fret,
ponders the city&#8217;s needs calmly by the lake
shore or in prairie villages. Chicago&#8217;s suburbs
are felicitously named&mdash;Kenilworth, Winnetka,
Hubbard Woods, Ravinia, Wilmette, Oak Park,
and Lake Forest. But neither the opulence of
Lake Forest and Winnetka, nor polo and a
famous golf-course at Wheaton can obscure
the merits of Evanston. The urban Chicagoan
becomes violent at the mention of Evanston,
yet here we find a reservoir of the true Western
folksiness, and Chicago profits by its propinquity.
Evanston goes to church, Evanston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
reads, Evanston is shamelessly high-brow with
a firm substratum of evangelicanism. Here,
on spring mornings, Chopin floats through
many windows across the pleasantest of hedges
and Dostoyefsky is enthroned by the evening
lamp. The girl who is always at the tennis-nets
or on the golf-links of Evanston is the same
girl one has heard at the piano, or whose profile
is limned against the lamp with the green shade
as she ponders the Russians. She is symbolic
and evocative of Chicago <i>in altissimo</i>. Her
father climbs the heights perforce that he may
not be deprived of her society. Fitted by nature
to adorn the bright halls of romance, she is
the sternest of realists. She discusses politics
with sophistication, and you may be sure she
belongs to many societies and can wield the
gavel with grace and ease. She buries herself
at times in a city settlement, for nothing is so
important to this young woman as the uplift
of the race; and in so far as the race&#8217;s destiny
is in her hands I cheerfully volunteer the opinion
that its future is bright.</p>

<p>I hope, however, to be acquitted of ungraciousness
if I say that the most delightful
person I ever met in Chicago, where an exacting
social taste may find amplest satisfaction,
and where, in the academic shades of three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
universities (Northwestern, Lake Forest, and
Chicago), one may find the answer to a question
in any of the arts or sciences&mdash;the most refreshing
and the most instructive of my encounters
was with a lady who followed the
vocation of a pickpocket and shoplifter. A
friend of mine who is engaged in the detection
of crime in another part of the universe had
undertaken to introduce me to the presence of
a &#8220;gunman,&#8221; a species of malefactor that had
previously eluded me. Meeting this detective
quite unexpectedly in Chicago, he made it possible
for me to observe numbers of gangsters,
or persons he vouched for as such&mdash;gentlemen
willing to commit murder for a fee so ridiculously
low that it would be immoral for me to
name it.</p>

<p>It is enough that I beheld and even conversed
with a worthy descendant of the murderers of
Elizabethan tragedy&mdash;one who might confess,
with the Second Murderer in Macbeth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent2">&#8220;I am one, my liege,</div>
<div class="verse">Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world</div>
<div class="verse">Have so incens&#8217;d that I am reckless what</div>
<div class="verse">I do to spite the world.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But it was even more thrilling to be admitted,
after a prearranged knock at the back door,
into the home of a woman of years whose life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
has been one long battle with the social order.
Assured by my friend that I was a trustworthy
person, or, in the vernacular, &#8220;all right,&#8221; she
entered with the utmost spirit into the discussion
of larceny as she had practised it. Only
a week earlier she had been released from the
Bridewell after serving a sentence for shoplifting,
and yet her incarceration&mdash;only one
of a series of imprisonments&mdash;had neither
embittered her nor dampened her zest for life.
She met my inquiries as to the hazards of the
game with the most engaging candor. I am
ashamed to confess that as she described her
adventures I could understand something of
the lawless joy she found in the pitting of her
wits against the law. She had lived in Chicago
all her life and knew its every corner. The
underworld was an open book to her; she patiently
translated for my benefit the thieves&#8217;
argot she employed fluently. She instructed
me with gusto and humor in the most approved
methods of shoplifting, with warnings as to
the machinery by which the big department
stores protect themselves from her kind. She
was equally wise as to the filching of purses,
explaining that this is best done by three conspirators
if a crowded street-car be the chosen
scene of operations. Her own function was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
usually the gentle seizure of the purse, to be
passed quickly back to a confederate, and he
in turn was charged with the responsibility of
conveying it to a third person, who was expected
to drop from the rear platform and escape.
Having elucidated this delicate transaction, she
laughed gleefully. &#8220;Once on a Wabash Avenue
car I nipped a purse from a woman&#8217;s lap and
passed it back, thinking a girl who was working
with me was right there, but say&mdash;I handed it
to a captain of police!&#8221; Her husband, a burglar
of inferior talents, sitting listlessly in the
dingy room that shook under the passing elevated
trains, took a sniff of cocaine. When I
professed interest in the proceeding she said she
preferred the hypodermic, and thereupon mixed
a potion for herself and thrust the needle into
an arm much swollen from frequent injections.
Only the other day, a year after this visit, I
learned that she was again in durance, this
time for an ingenious attempt to defraud an
insurance company.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In the field of social effort Chicago has long
stood at the fore, and the experiments have
continued until a good many debatable points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
as to method have been determined. Hull
House and Miss Jane Addams are a part of
American history. There are those in Chicago
who are skeptical as to the value of much of
the machinery employed in social betterment,
but they may be silenced effectively by a question
as to just what the plight of the two and
a half million would be if so many high-minded
people had not consecrated themselves to the
task of translating America into terms of service
for the guidance and encouragement of the
poor and ignorant. The spirit of this endeavor
is that expressed in Arnold&#8217;s lines on Goethe:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;He took the suffering human race,</div>
<div class="verse">He read each wound, each weakness clear;</div>
<div class="verse">And struck his finger on the place</div>
<div class="verse">And said: Thou ailest here and here!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And when the diagnosis has been made some
one in this city of hope is ready with a remedy.</p>

<p>When I remarked to a Chicago alderman
upon the great number of agencies at work in
Chicago for social betterment, he said, with
manifest pride: &#8220;This town is full of idealists!&#8221;
What strikes the visitor is that so many of these
idealists are practical-minded men and women
who devote a prodigious amount of time, energy,
and money to the promotion of social welfare.
It is impossible to examine a cross-section anywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
without finding vestigia of welfare effort,
or traces of the movements for political reform
represented in the Municipal Voters&#8217; League,
the Legislative League, or the City Club.</p>

<p>It is admitted (grudgingly in some quarters)
that the strengthening of the social fabric has
carried with it an appreciable elevation of political
ideals, though the proof of this is less impressive
than we should like to have it. It is
unfortunately true that an individual may
be subjected to all possible saving influences&mdash;transformed
into a clean, reputable being, yet
continue to view his political obligations as
through a glass darkly. Nor is the average
citizen of old American stock, who is satisfied,
very often, to accept any kind of local government
so long as he is not personally annoyed
about it, a wholly inspiring example to the
foreign-born. The reformer finds it necessary
to work coincidentally at both ends of the social
scale. The preservation of race groups in Chicago&#8217;s
big wards (the vote in these political
units ranges from eight to thirty-six thousand),
is essential to safe manipulation. The bosses
are not interested in the successful operation
of the melting-pot. It is much easier for them
to buy votes collectively from a padrone than
to negotiate with individuals whose minds have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
been &#8220;corrupted&#8221; by the teachers of political
honesty in settlements and neighborhood
houses. However, the Chicago bosses enjoy
little tranquillity; some agency is constantly
on their heels with an impudent investigation
that endangers their best-laid devices for &#8220;protection.&#8221;</p>

<p>As an Americanizing influence, important as
a means of breaking-up race affiliations that
facilitate the &#8220;delivery&#8221; of votes, Chicago has
developed a type of recreation park that gives
promise of the best results. The first of these
were opened in the South Park district in 1905.
There are now thirty-five such centres, which,
without paralleling or infringing upon the work
of other social agencies, greatly widen the scope
of the city&#8217;s social service. These parks comprise
a playground with baseball diamond,
tennis-courts, an outdoor swimming-pool, playgrounds
for young children, and a field-house
containing a large assembly-hall, club-rooms, a
branch library, and shower-baths with locker-rooms
for men and women. Skating is offered
as a winter diversion, and the halls may be used
for dances, dramatic, musical, and other neighborhood
entertainments. Clubs organized for
the study of civic questions meet in these houses;
there are special classes for the instruction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
foreigners in the mystery of citizenship; and
schemes of welfare work are discussed in the
neighborhood councils that are encouraged to
debate municipal problems and to initiate new
methods of social service. A typical centre is
Dvor&aacute;k Park, ninety-five per cent of whose
patrons are Bohemians. Among its organizations
are a Bohemian Old Settlers&#8217; Club and a
Servant Girls&#8217; Chorus. Colonel H. C. Carbaugh,
of the Civil Service Board of South
Park Commissioners, in an instructive volume,
&#8220;Human Welfare Work in Chicago,&#8221; calls these
park centres &#8220;public community clearing-houses.&#8221;
They appeal the more strongly to
the neighborhoods they serve from the fact
that they are provided by the municipality,
and, while under careful and sympathetic supervision,
are in a very true sense the property
of the people. Visits are exchanged by the
musical, gymnastic, or other societies of the
several communities, with a view to promoting
fellowship between widely separated neighborhoods.</p>

<p>One has but to ask in Chicago whether some
particular philanthropic or welfare work has
been undertaken to be borne away at once to
observe that very thing in successful operation.
It is a fair statement that no one need walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the streets of the city hungry. Many doors
stand ajar for the despairing. A common indictment
of the churches, that they have neglected
the practical application of Christianity
to humanity&#8217;s needs, hardly holds against Chicago&#8217;s
churches. The Protestant Episcopal
Church has long been zealous in philanthropic
and welfare work, and Methodists, Presbyterians
and Baptists are conspicuously active in
these fields. The Catholic Church in Chicago
extends a helping hand through forty-five alert
and well-managed agencies. The total disbursement
of the Associated Jewish Charities
for the year ending May, 1916, was $593,466,
and the Jewish people of Chicago contribute
generously to social-welfare efforts outside their
fold. The Young Men&#8217;s Christian Association
conducts a great number of enterprises, including
a nineteen-story hotel, built at a cost of
$1,350,000, which affords temporary homes to
the thousands of young men who every year
seek employment in Chicago. This huge structure
contains 1,821 well-ventilated rooms that
are rented at from thirty to fifty cents a day.
The Chicago Association has twenty-nine widely
distributed branches, offering recreation, vocational
instruction, and spiritual guidance. The
Salvation Army addresses itself tirelessly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Chicago&#8217;s human problem. Colonel Carbaugh
thus summarizes the army&#8217;s work for the year
ending in September, 1916: &#8220;At the various
institutions for poor men and women 151,501
beds and meals were worked for; besides which
$38,779.98 in cash was paid to the inmates for
work done. To persons who were not in a position
to work, or whom it was impossible to
supply with work, 111,354 beds and meals, 11,330
garments and pairs of shoes, and 123 tons
of coal were given without charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jaunty inquirer for historical evidences&mdash;hoary
ruins &#8220;out of fashion, like a rusty mail
in monumental mockery&#8221;&mdash;is silenced by the
multiplicity of sentry-houses that mark the line
of social regeneration and security. Chicago is
carving her destiny and in no small degree
moulding the future of America by these laborious
processes brought to bear upon humanity
itself. Perhaps the seeker in quest of the spirit
of Chicago better serves himself by sitting for
an hour in a community centre, in a field-house,
in the juvenile court, in one of the hundreds of
places where the human problem is met and
dealt with hourly than in perusing tables of
statistics.</p>

<p>At every turn one is aware that no need, no
abuse is neglected, and an immeasurable patience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
characterizes all this labor. One looks at
Chicago&#8217;s worst slum with a sense that after all
it is not so bad, or that at any rate it is not
hopeless. Nothing is hopeless in a city where
the highest reach down so constantly to the
lowest, where the will to protect, to save, to
lift is everywhere so manifest. This will, this
determination is well calculated to communicate
a certain awe to the investigator: no other expression
of the invincible Chicago spirit is so
impressive as this.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p><i>Anno Urbis Condit&aelig;</i> may not be appended
to any year in the chronicles of a city that has
so repeatedly rebuilt itself and that goes cheerfully
on demolishing yesterday&#8217;s structures to
make way for the nobler achievements of to-morrow.
While the immediate effect of the
World&#8217;s Columbian Exposition of 1892-3 was
to quicken the civic impulse and arouse Chicago
to a sense of her own powers, a lasting and concrete
result is found in the ambition inspired
by the architectural glories of the fair to invoke
the same arts for the city&#8217;s permanent beautification.
The genius of Mr. Daniel H. Burnham,
who waved the magic wand that summoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
&#8220;pillared arch and sculptured dome&#8221; out of flat
prairie and established &#8220;the White City&#8221; to
live as a happy memory for many millions in
all lands, was enlisted for the greater task.
Without the fair as a background the fine talents
of Mr. Burnham and his collaborator, Mr. Edward
H. Bennett, might never have been exercised
upon the city. Chicago thinks in large
terms, and being properly pleased with the
demonstration of its ability to carry through
an undertaking of heroic magnitude it immediately
sought other fields to conquer. The
fair had hardly closed its doors before Mr. Burnham
and Mr. Bennett were engaged by the
Commercial Club to prepare comprehensive
plans for the perpetuation of something of the
charm and beauty of the fairy city as a permanent
and predominating feature of Chicago.
Clearly what served so well as a temporary
matter might fill the needs of all time. The
architects boldly attacked the problem of establishing
as the outer line, the fa&ccedil;ade of the city,
something distinctive, a combination of landscape
and architecture such as no other American
city has ever created out of sheer pride,
determination, and sound taste. Like the
&aelig;sthetic problems, the practical difficulties imposed
by topography, commercial pre-emptions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
and legal embarrassments were intrusted only
to competent and sympathetic hands. The
whole plan, elaborated in a handsome volume
published in 1909, with the effects contemplated
happily anticipated in the colored drawings of
Mr. Jules Gu&eacute;rin, fixed definitely an ideal and
a goal.</p>

<p>This programme was much described and
discussed at the time of its inception, and I
had ignorantly assumed that it had been neglected
in the pressure of matters better calculated
to resound in bank clearings, but I had
grossly misjudged the firmness of the Chicago
fibre. The death of Mr. Burnham left the
architectural responsibilities of the work in
the very capable hands of Mr. Bennett. The
Commercial Club, an organization of highest
intelligence and influence, steadfastly supported
the plan until it was reinforced by a strong
public demand for its fulfilment. The movement
has been greatly assisted by Mr. Charles
H. Wacker, president of the plan commission
and the author of a primer on the subject that
is used in the public schools. Mr. Wacker&#8217;s
vigorous propaganda, through the press and
by means of illustrated lectures in school and
neighborhood houses, has tended to the democratizing
of what might have passed as a fanciful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
scheme of no interest to the great body of
the people.</p>

<p>With singular perversity nature vouchsafed
the fewest possible aids to the architect for the
embellishment of a city that had grown to
prodigious size before it became conscious of
its artistic deficiencies. The lake washes a
flat beach, unbroken by any islanded bay to
rest the eye, and the back door is level with
limitless prairie. There is no hill on which to
plant an acropolis, and the Chicago River (transformed
into a canal by clever engineering) offered
little to the landscape-architect at any
stage of its history. However, the distribution
of parks is excellent, and they are among the
handsomest in the world. These, looped together
by more than eighty miles of splendid
boulevards, afford four thousand acres of open
space. The early pre-emption of the lake front
by railroad-tracks added to the embarrassments
of the artist, but the plan devised by Messrs.
Burnham and Bennett conceals them by a
broadening of Grant Park that cannot fail to
produce an effect of distinction and charm.
Chicago has a playful habit of driving the lake
back at will, and it is destined to farther recessions.
When the prodigious labors involved
in the plan are completed the lake may be contemplated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
across green esplanades, broken by
lagoons; peristyles and statuary will be a feature
of the transformed landscape. The new Field
Museum is architecturally consonant with the
general plan; a new art museum and other
buildings are promised that will add to the
variety and picturesqueness of the whole. With
Michigan Avenue widened and brought into
harmony with Grant Park, thus extended and
beautified and carried across the river northward
to a point defined at present by the old
water-tower (one of Chicago&#8217;s few antiquities),
landscape architecture will have set a new mark
in America. The congestion of north and
south bound traffic on Michigan Avenue will be
relieved by a double-decked bridge, making possible
the classification of traffic and the exclusion
of heavy vehicles from the main thoroughfare.
All this is promised very soon, now that necessary
legislation and legal decisions are clearing
the way. The establishment of a civic centre,
with a grouping of public buildings that would
make possible further combinations in keeping
with those that are to lure the eye at the lakeside
is projected, but may be left for another
generation to accomplish.</p>

<p>Chicago&#8217;s absorption in social service and
well-planned devices for taking away the reproach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
of its ugliness is not at the expense of
the grave problems presented by its politics.
Here again the inquirer is confronted by a
formidable array of citizens, effectively organized,
who are bent upon making Chicago a
safe place for democracy. That Chicago shall
be the best-governed city in America is the
aspiration of great numbers of men and women,
and one is struck once more not merely by the
energy expended in these matters but by the
thoroughness and far-sightedness of the efforts
for political betterment. Illinois wields so great
an influence in national affairs that strictly
municipal questions suffer in Chicago as in
every other American city where the necessities
of partisan politics constantly obscure local
issues. The politics of Chicago is bewilderingly
complicated by the complexity of its governmental
machinery.</p>

<p>It is staggering to find that the city has not
one but, in effect, twenty-two distinct governing
agencies, all intrusted with the taxing power!
These include the city of Chicago, a board of
education, a library board, the Municipal Tuberculosis
Sanitarium, the county government of
Cook County, the sanitary district of Chicago,
and sixteen separate boards of park commissioners.
The interests represented in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
organizations are, of course, identical in so far
as the taxpaying citizen is concerned. An
exhaustive report of the Chicago Bureau of
Public Efficiency published in January, 1917,
reaches the conclusion that &#8220;this community
is poorly served by its hodgepodge of irresponsible
governing agencies, not only independent
of one another but often pulling and hauling
at cross-purposes. A single governing agency,
in which should be centred all the local administrative
and legislative functions of the community,
but directly responsible to the voters,
would be able to render services which existing
agencies could not perform nearly so well, if
at all, even if directed by officials of exceptional
ability. The present system, however, instead
of attracting to public employment men of
exceptional ability, tends to keep them out,
with the result that the places are left at the
disposal of partisan-spoils political leaders.&#8221;</p>

<p>The waste entailed by this multiplication of
agencies and resulting diffusion of power and
responsibility is illustrated by the number of
occasions on which the citizen is called upon
to register and vote. The election expenses of
Chicago and Cook County for 1916 were more
than two million dollars, an increase of one
hundred per cent in four years. This does not,
of course, take account of the great sums expended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
by candidates and party organizations,
or the waste caused by the frequent interruptions
to normal business. Chicago&#8217;s calendar
of election events for 1918 includes opportunities
for registration in February, March, August,
and October; city primaries in February;
general primaries in September; a city election
in April; and a general election in November.</p>

<p>Under the plan of unified government proposed
by the Bureau of Efficiency there would
be but three regular elections in each four-year
period, two biennial elections for national and
State officials, and one combined municipal
and judicial election. A consolidation and
reform of the judicial machinery of Cook County
and Chicago is urged by the bureau, which
complains that the five county courts and the
municipal court of Chicago, whose functions
are largely concurrent, cost annually two and
a quarter million. There are six separate clerks&#8217;
offices and a small army of deputy sheriffs and
bailiffs to serve these courts, with an evident
paralleling of labor. While the city and county
expend nearly a million dollars annually for
legal services, this is not the whole item, for
the library board, the board of education, and
committees of the city council may, on occasion,
employ special counsel.</p>

<p>The policing of so large a city, whose very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
geographical position makes it a convenient
way station for criminals of every sort, where
so many races are to be dealt with, and where
the existing form of municipal government
keeps politics constantly to the fore, is beset
with well-nigh insuperable obstacles. Last year
the police department passed through a fierce
storm with what seems to be a resulting improvement
in conditions. An investigator of
the Committee of Fifteen, a citizens&#8217; organization,
declared in May, 1917, that ten per cent
of the men on the police force are &#8220;inherently
crooked and ought to be driven from the department.&#8221;
To which a police official retorted
that for every crooked policeman there are
500 crooked citizens, an ill-tempered aspersion
too shocking for acceptance. The <i>Chicago Daily
News Almanac</i> records 114,625 arrests in 1915.
Half of the total are set down as Americans;
there were 9,508 negroes, 4,739 Germans, 2,144
Greeks, 7,644 Polanders, 5,577 Russians, 2,981
Italians, and 2,565 Irish. In that year there
were 194 murders&mdash;35 fewer than in 1914.
Comparisons in such matters are not profitable
but it may be interesting to note that in 1915
there were 222 murders in New York; 244 in
1914; 265 in 1913. Over 3,000 keepers and inmates
of Chicago gaming-houses were arrested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
in 1915. The cost of the police department is
in excess of $7,000,000&mdash;an amount just about
balanced by the license fee paid by the city&#8217;s
seven thousand saloons. Until recently the
State law closing saloons on Sunday was ignored,
but last year the city police department
undertook to enforce it, with (to the casual eye)
a considerable degree of success.</p>

<p>The report of the Bureau of Efficiency recommends
the consolidation of the existing governing
agencies into a single government headed
by an executive of the city-manager type. Instead
of a political mayor elected by popular
vote the office would be filled by the city council
for an indefinite tenure. The incumbent would
be the executive officer of the council and he
might be given a seat in that body without a
vote. The council would be free to go outside
the city if necessary in its search for a competent
mayor under this council-manager plan. One
has but to read the Chicago newspapers to be
satisfied that some such change as here indicated
is essential to the wise and economical government
of the city. Battles between the mayor
and the council, upheavals in one city department
or another occur constantly with a serious
loss of municipal dignity. With deep humility
I confess my incompetence for the task of describing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
the present mayor of Chicago, Mr.
William Hale Thompson, whose antics since he
assumed office have given Chicago a vast
amount of painful publicity. As a public official
his manifold infelicities (I hope the term is
sufficiently delicate) have at least served to
strengthen the arguments in favor of the recall
as a means of getting rid of an unfit office-holder.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
Last year a general shaking up of the
police department had hardly faded from the
head-lines before the city&#8217;s school system, a frequent
storm-centre, caught the limelight. The
schools are managed by a board of trustees appointed
by the mayor. On a day last spring
(1917) the board met and discharged the superintendent
of schools (though retaining him temporarily),
and, if we may believe the news columns
of the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>, &#8220;Chicago&#8217;s mayor
was roped, thrown, and tied so rapidly that the
crowd gasped, laughed, and broke into a cheer
almost in one moment.&#8221; I mention this episode,
which was followed in a few weeks by the reinstatement
of the superintendent with an increase
of salary, as justifying the demand for a form
of government that will perform its functions
decently and in order and without constant disturbances
of the public service that result only
in the encouragement of incompetence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>The politicians will not relinquish so big a
prize without a struggle; but one turns from
the dark side of the picture to admire the many
hopeful, persistent agencies that are addressing
themselves to the correction of these evils. The
best talents of the city are devoted to just these
things. The trustees of the Bureau of Public
Efficiency are Julius Rosenwald, Alfred L.
Baker, Onward Bates, George G. Tunnell,
Walter L. Fisher, Victor Elting, Allen B. Pond,
and Frank I. Moulton, whose names are worthy
of all honor as typical of Chicago&#8217;s most successful
and public-spirited citizens. The City
Club, with a membership of 2,400, is a wide-awake
organization whose 27 civic committees,
enlisting the services of 500 members, are constantly
studying municipal questions, instituting
inquiries, and initiating &#8220;movements&#8221; well
calculated to annoy and alarm the powers that
prey.</p>

<p>Space that I had reserved for some note of
Chicago&#8217;s industries, the vastness of the stock-yards,
the great totals in beasts and dollars
represented in the meat-packing business, the
lake and railroad tonnage, and like matters,
shrinks under pressure of what seem, on the
whole, to be things of greater interest and
significance. That the total receipts of live-stock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
for one year exceeded 14,000,000 with a
cash value of $370,938,156 strikes me as less
impressive than the fact that a few miles distant
from the packing-houses exists an art institute,
visited by approximately a million persons annually,
and an art school that affords capable
instruction to 3,000 students. Every encouragement
is extended to these pupils, nor is the artist,
once launched upon his career, neglected by
the community. The city provides, through a
Commission for the Encouragement of Local
Art, for the purchase of paintings by Chicago
artists. There are a variety of private organizations
that extend a helping hand to the tyro,
and lectures and concerts are abundantly provided.
A few years ago the National Institute
of Arts and Letters met for the first time in
Chicago. It must have been with a certain
humor that the citizens spread for the members,
who came largely from the East, a royal banquet
in the Sculpture Hall of the Institute, as
though to present Donatello and Verrocchio as
the real hosts of the occasion. It is by such
manifestations that Chicago is prone to stifle
the charge of philistinism.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_176.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Banquet given for the members of the National Institute of Arts and
Letters.</p>

<p>With a noteworthy absence of self-consciousness,
Chicago assimilates a great deal of music.
The symphony orchestra, founded by Theodore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
Thomas and conducted since his death by
Frederic Stock, offers a series of twenty-eight
concerts a year. Eight thousand contributors
made possible the building of Orchestra Hall,
the organization&#8217;s permanent home. Boston is
not more addicted to symphonies than Chicago.
Indeed, on afternoons when concerts are
scheduled the agitations of the musically minded
in popular refectories, the presence in Michigan
Avenue of suburban young women, whom one
identifies at sight as devotees of Bach and
Brahms, suggest similar scenes that are a part
of the life of Boston. The luxury of grand opera
is offered for ten weeks every winter by artists
of first distinction; and it was Chicago, we shall
frequently be reminded, that called New York&#8217;s
attention to the merits of Mme. Galli-Curci.
Literature too is much to the fore in Chicago,
but I shall escape from the task of enumerating
its many practitioners by pleading that only a
volume would do justice to the subject. The
contributors to Mr. Bert Leston Taylor&#8217;s &#8220;Line
o&#8217; Type&#8221; column in the <i>Tribune</i> testify daily to
the prevalence of the poetic impulse within the
city and of an alert, mustang, critical spirit.</p>

<p>With all its claims to cosmopolitanism one is
nevertheless conscious that Chicago is only a
prairie county-seat that is continually outgrowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
its bounds, but is striving to maintain its
early fundamental devotion to decency and
order, and develop among its millions the respect
for those things that are more excellent
that is so distinguishing a trait of the Folks
throughout the West. Chicago&#8217;s strength is
the strength of the soil that was won for civilization
and democracy by a great and valorous
body of pioneer freemen; and the Chicago spirit
is that of the men and women who plunged into
the West bearing in their hearts that &#8220;something
pretty fine&#8221; (in Lincoln&#8217;s phrase), which
was the ideal of the founders of the republic.
&#8220;The children of the light&#8221; are numerous
enough to make the materialists and the philistines
uncomfortable if not heartily ashamed of
themselves; for it is rather necessary in Chicago
to have &#8220;interests,&#8221; to manifest some degree of
curiosity touching the best that has been thought
and done in the world, and to hold a commission
to help and to serve the community and
the nation, to win the highest esteem.</p>

<p>Every weakness and every element of strength
in democracy, as we are experimenting with it,
has definite and concrete presentment in Chicago.
In the trying months preceding and
following the declaration of war with Germany
the city repeatedly asserted its intense patriotism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
The predominating foreign-born population
is German, yet once the die was cast these
citizens were found, except in negligible instances,
supporting the American cause as loyally
as their neighbors of old American stock.
The city&#8217;s patriotic ardor was expressed repeatedly
in popular demonstrations&mdash;beginning
with a preparedness parade in June, 1916, in
which 150,000 persons participated; in public
gatherings designed to unify sentiment, not least
noteworthy of these being the meeting in the
stock-yards pavilion in May, of last year, when
12,000 people greeted Colonel Roosevelt. The
visit of M. Viviani and Field-Marshal Joffre
afforded the city another opportunity to manifest
its devotion to the cause of democracy.
Every responsibility entailed by America&#8217;s entrance
into the war was met immediately with
an enthusiasm so hearty that the Chicago press
was to be pardoned for indulging in ironic flings
at the East, which had been gloomily apprehensive
as to the attitude of the Middle West.</p>

<p>The flag flies no more blithely or securely
anywhere in America than in the great city
that lies at the northern edge of the prairies
that gave Lincoln to be the savior of the nation.
Those continuing experiments and that struggle
for perfection that are the task of democracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
have here their fullest manifestation, and the
knowledge that these processes and undertakings
are nobly guided must be a stimulus and an inspiration
to all who have at heart the best that
may be sought and won for America.</p>

THE MIDDLE WEST IN POLITICS</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The great interior region bounded east by the Alleghanies, north
by the British dominions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and
south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets

within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake.
It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the United
States&mdash;certainly more than 1,000,000 square miles. Once half
as populous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than
75,000,000 people. A glance at the map shows that, territorially
speaking, it is the great body of the republic. The other parts are

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IF a general participation in politics is essential
to the successful maintenance of a
democracy, then the people of the West
certainly bear their share of the national burden.
A great deal of history has been made
in what Lincoln called &#8220;the great body of the
republic,&#8221; and the election of 1916 indicated
very clearly the growing power of the West in
national contests, and a manifestation of independence
that is not negligible in any conjectures
as to the issues and leadership of the
immediate future.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>A few weeks before the last general election I
crossed a Middle Western State in company
with one of its senators, a veteran politician,
who had served his party as State chairman and
as chairman of the national committee. In the
smoking compartment was a former governor of
an Eastern State and several others, representing
both the major parties, who were bound for
various points along the line where they were to
speak that night. In our corner the talk was
largely reminiscent of other times and bygone
statesmen. Republicans and Democrats exchanged
anecdotes with that zest which distinguishes
the Middle Western politician, men of
one party paying tribute to the character and
ability of leaders of the other in a fine spirit of
magnanimity. As the train stopped, from time
to time, the United States senator went out upon
the platform and shook hands with friends and
acquaintances, or received reports from local
leaders. Everybody on the train knew him;
many of the men called him by his first name.
He talked to the women about their children
and asked about their husbands. The whole
train caught the spirit of his cheer and friendliness,
and yet he had been for a dozen years the
most abused man in his State. This was all in
the day&#8217;s work, a part of what has been called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the great American game. The West makes
something intimate and domestic of its politics,
and the idea that statesmen must &#8220;keep close
to the people&#8221; is not all humbug, not at least
in the sense that they hold their power very
largely through their social qualities. They
must, as we say, be &#8220;folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apart from wars, the quadrennial presidential
campaigns are America&#8217;s one great national
expression in terms of drama; but through
months in which the average citizen goes about
his business, grateful for a year free of political
turmoil, the political machinery is never idle.
No matter how badly defeated a party may be,
its State organization must not be permitted to
fall to pieces; for the perfecting of an organization
demands hard work and much money.
There is always a great deal of inner plotting
preliminary to a State or national contest, and
much of this is wholly without the knowledge of
the quiet citizen whose active interests are
never aroused until a campaign is well launched.
In State capitals and other centres men meet,
as though by chance, and in hotel-rooms debate
matters of which the public hears only when
differences have been reconciled and a harmonious
plan of action has been adopted. Not a
day passes even in an &#8220;off year&#8221; when in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
corn belt men are not travelling somewhere on
political errands. There are fences to repair,
local conditions to analyze, and organizations
to perfect against the coming of the next campaign.
In a Western State I met within the
year two men who had just visited their governor
for the purpose of throwing some &#8220;pep&#8221;
into him. They had helped to elect him and
felt free to beard him in the capitol to caution
him as to his conduct. It is impossible to step
off a train anywhere between Pittsburgh and
Denver without becoming acutely conscious
that much politics is forward. One campaign
&#8220;doth tread upon another&#8217;s heel, so fast they
follow.&#8221; This does not mean merely that the
leaders in party organizations meet constantly
for conferences, or that candidates are plotting a
long way ahead to secure nominations, but that
the great body of the people&mdash;the Folks themselves&mdash;are
ceaselessly discussing new movements
or taking the measure of public servants.</p>

<p>The politician lives by admiration; he likes
to be pointed out, to have men press about him
to shake his hand. He will enter a State convention
at just the right moment to be greeted
with a cheer, of which a nonchalant or deprecatory
wave of the hand is a sufficient recognition.
Many small favors of which the public never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
dreams are granted to the influential politician,
even when he is not an office-holder&mdash;favors that
mean much to him, that contribute to his self-esteem.
A friend who was secretary for several
years of one of the national committees had a
summer home by a quiet lake near an east-and-west
railway-line. When, during a campaign,
he was suddenly called to New York or Chicago
he would wire the railway authorities to order
one of the fast trains to pick him up at a lonely
station, which it passed ordinarily at the highest
speed. My friend derived the greatest satisfaction
from this concession to his prominence
and influence. Men who affect to despise politicians
of the party to which they are opposed
are nevertheless flattered by any attention from
them, and they will admit, when there is no
campaign forward, that in spite of their politics
they are mighty good fellows. And they <i>are</i>
good fellows; they have to be to retain their
hold upon their constituents. There are exceptions
to the rule that to succeed in politics one
must be a good fellow, a folksy person, but they
are few. Cold, crafty men who are not &#8220;good
mixers&#8221; may sometimes gain a great deal of
power, but in the Western provinces they make
poor candidates. The Folks don&#8217;t like &#8217;em!</p>

<p>Outside of New York and Pennsylvania,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
where much the same phenomena are observable,
there is no region where the cards are so
tirelessly shuffled as in the Middle Western commonwealths,
particularly in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
and Kansas, which no party can pretend to
carry jauntily in its pocket. Men enjoy the
game because of its excitement, its potentialities
of preferment, the chance that a few votes
delivered in the right quarter may upset all
calculations and send a lucky candidate for governor
on his way to the Federal Senate or even
to the White House. And in country towns
where there isn&#8217;t much to do outside of routine
business the practice of politics is a welcome
&#8220;side-line.&#8221; There is a vast amount of fun to
be got out of it; and one who is apt at the game
may win a county office or &#8220;go&#8221; to the legislature.</p>

<p>To be summoned from a dull job in a small
town to a conference called suddenly and mysteriously
at the capital, to be invited to sit
at the council-table with the leaders, greatly
arouses the pride and vanity of men to whom,
save for politics, nothing of importance ever
happens. There are, I fancy, few American
citizens who don&#8217;t hug the delusion that they
have political &#8220;influence.&#8221; This vanity is responsible
for much party regularity. To have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
influence a man must keep his record clear of
any taint of independence, or else he must be
influential enough as an independent to win the
respect of both sides, and this latter class is exceedingly
small. At some time in his life every
citizen seeks an appointment for a friend, or
finds himself interested in local or State or national
legislation. It is in the mind of the contributor
to a campaign fund that the party of
his allegiance has thus a concrete expression of
his fidelity, and if he &#8220;wants something&#8221; he
has opened a channel through which to make a
request with a reasonable degree of confidence
that it will not be ignored. There was a time
when it was safe to give to both sides impartially
so that no matter who won the battle
the contributor would have established an obligation;
but this practice has not worked so
satisfactorily since the institution of publicity
for campaign assessments.</p>

<p>It is only immediately after an election that
one hears criticisms of party management from
within a party. A campaign is a great time-eater,
and when a man has given six months
or possibly a year of hard work to making an
aggressive fighting machine of his party he is
naturally grieved when it goes down in defeat.
In the first few weeks following the election of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
1916 Western Republicans complained bitterly
of the conduct of the national campaign. Unhappily,
no amount of <i>a posteriori</i> reasoning
can ever determine whether, if certain things
had been handled differently, a result would
have been changed. If Mr. Hughes had not
visited California, or, venturing into that commonwealth,
he had shaken the hand of Governor
Hiram Johnson, or if he had remained quietly
on his veranda at home and made no speeches,
would he have been elected President? Speculations
of this kind may alleviate the poignancy
of defeat, but as a political situation is rarely
or never repeated they are hardly profitable.</p>

<p>There are phases of political psychology that
defy analysis. For example, in doubtful States
there are shifting moods of hope and despair
which are wholly unrelated to tangible events
and not reconcilable with &#8220;polls&#8221; and other pre-election
tests. Obscure influences and counter-currents
may be responsible, but often the politicians
do not attempt to account for these alternations
of &#8220;feeling.&#8221; When, without warning,
the barometer at headquarters begins to fall,
even the messengers and stenographers are
affected. The gloom may last for a day or two
or even for a week; then the chairman issues a
statement &#8220;claiming&#8221; everything, every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
takes heart of hope, and the dread spectre of
defeat steals away to the committee-rooms of
the opposition.</p>

<p>An interesting species are the oracles whose
views are sought by partisans anxious for trustworthy
&#8220;tips.&#8221; These &#8220;medicine-men&#8221; may
not be actively engaged in politics, or only
hangers-on at headquarters, but they are supposed
to be endowed with the gift of prophecy.
I know several such seers whose views on no
other subject are entitled to the slightest consideration,
and yet I confess to a certain respect
for their judgment as to the outcome of an election.
Late in the fall of 1916, at a time when the
result was most uncertain, a friend told me that
he was wagering a large sum on Mr. Wilson&#8217;s
success. Asked to explain his confidence, he
said he was acting on the advice of an obscure
citizen, whom he named, who always &#8220;guessed
right.&#8221; This prophet&#8217;s reasoning was wholly
by inspiration; he had a &#8220;hunch.&#8221; State and
county committee-rooms are infested with
elderly men who commune among themselves
as to old, unhappy, far-off things and battles
long ago, and wait for a chance to whisper some
rumor into the ear of a person of importance.
Their presence and their misinformation add
little to the joy of the engrossed, harassed strategists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
who spend much time dodging them, but
appoint a subordinate of proved patience to
listen to their stories.</p>

<p>To be successful a State chairman must
possess a genius for organization and administration,
and a capacity for quick decision and
action. While he must make no mistakes himself,
it is his business to correct the blunders of
his lieutenants and turn to good account the
errors of his adversary. He must know how
and where to get money, and how to use it to
the best advantage. There are always local
conditions in his territory that require judicious
handling, and he must deal with these
personally or send just the right man to smooth
them out. Harmony is the great watchword,
and such schisms as that of the Sound Money
Democrats in 1896, the Progressive split of
1912, and the frequent anti-organization fights
that are a part of the great game leave much
harsh jangling behind.</p>

<p>The West first kicked up its heels in a national
campaign in the contest of 1840, when
William Henry Harrison, a native of Virginia
who had won renown as a soldier in the Ohio
Valley and served as governor of the Northwest
Territory, was the Whig candidate. The campaign
was flavored with hard cider and keyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
to the melody of &#8220;Tippecanoe and Tyler too.&#8221;
The log cabin, with a raccoon on the roof or
with a pelt of the species nailed to the outer
wall, and a cider-barrel seductively displayed
in the foreground, were popular party symbols.
The rollicking campaign songs of 1840 reflect
not only the cheery pioneer spirit but the bitterness
of the contest between Van Buren and
Harrison. One of the most popular ballads was
a buckeye-cabin song sung to the tune of &#8220;The
Blue Bells of Scotland&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;Oh, how, tell me how does your buckeye cabin go?</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, how, tell me how does your buckeye cabin go?</div>
<div class="verse">It goes against the spoilsman, for well its builders know</div>
<div class="verse">It was Harrison who fought for the cabins long ago.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, who fell before him in battle, tell me who?</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, who fell before him in battle, tell me who?</div>
<div class="verse">He drove the savage legions and British armies, too,</div>
<div class="verse">At the Rapids and the Thames and old Tippecanoe.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, what, tell me what will little Martin do?</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, what, then, what will little Martin do?</div>
<div class="verse">He&#8217;ll follow the footsteps of Price and Swartout, too,</div>
<div class="verse">While the log cabins ring again with Tippecanoe!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The spirit of the &#8217;40&#8217;s pervaded Western
politics for many years after that strenuous
campaign. Men who had voted for &#8220;Tippecanoe&#8221;
Harrison were pointed out as citizens
of unusual worth and dignity in my youth; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
organizations of these veterans were still in existence
and attentive to politics when Harrison&#8217;s
grandson was a candidate for the Presidency.</p>

<p>I find myself referring frequently to the continuing
influence of the Civil War in the social
and political life of these Western States. The
&#8220;soldier vote&#8221; was long to be reckoned with,
and it was not until Mr. Cleveland brought a
new spirit into our politics that the war between
the States began to fade as a political factor; and
even then we were assured that if the Democrats
succeeded they would pension Confederate soldiers
and redeem the Confederate bonds. There
were a good many of us in these border States
who, having been born of soldier fathers, and
with Whig and Republican antecedents, began
to resent the continued emphasis of the war in
every campaign; and I look back upon Mr.
Cleveland&#8217;s rise as of very great importance in
that he was a messenger of new and attractive
ideals of public service that appealed strongly
to young men. But my political apostasy (I
speak of my own case because it is in some
sense typical) was attended with no diminution
of reverence for that great citizen army that
defended and saved the Union. The annual
gatherings of the Grand Army of the Republic
have grown pathetically smaller, but this organization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
is not a negligible expression of
American democracy. The writing of these
pages has been interrupted constantly by bugle-calls
floating in from the street, by the cheers
of crowds wishing Godspeed to our young army
in its high adventure beyond the Atlantic, and
at the moment, by stirring news of American
valor and success in France. In my boyhood
I viewed with awe and admiration the veterans
of &#8217;61-&#8217;65 and my patriotism was deeply influenced
by the atmosphere in which I was
born, by acquaintance with my father&#8217;s comrades,
and quickened through my formative
years by attendance at encampments of the
Grand Army of the Republic and cheery
&#8220;camp-fires&#8221; in the hall of George H. Thomas
Post, Indianapolis, where privates and generals
met for story-telling and the singing of war-songs.
The honor which it was part of my
education should be accorded those men will, I
reflect, soon be the portion of their grandsons,
the men of 1917-18, and we shall have
very likely a new Grand Army of the Republic,
with the difference that the descendants of men
who fought under Grant and Sherman will meet
at peaceful &#8220;camp-fires&#8221; with grandsons of the
soldiers of Lee and Jackson, quite unconscious
that this was ever other than a united nation.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The West has never lost its early admiration
for oratory, whether from the hustings, the pulpit,
or the lecture-platform. Many of the
pioneer preachers of the Ohio valley were orators
of distinguished ability, and their frequent
joint debates on such subjects as predestination
and baptism drew great audiences from the
countryside. Both religious and political meetings
were held preferably out of doors to accommodate
the crowds that collected from the
far-scattered farms. A strong voice, a confident
manner, and matter so composed as to
hold the attention of an audience which would
not hesitate to disperse if it lost interest were
prerequisites of the successful speaker. Western
chronicles lay great stress upon the oratorical
powers of both ministers and politicians.
Henry Ward Beecher, who held a pastorate at
Indianapolis (1839-47), was already famed as
an eloquent preacher before he moved to
Brooklyn. Not long ago I heard a number of
distinguished politicians discussing American
oratory. Some one mentioned the addresses
delivered by Beecher in England during the
Civil War, and there was general agreement
that one of these, the Liverpool speech, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
probably the greatest of American orations&mdash;a
sweeping statement, but its irresistible logic
and a sense of the hostile atmosphere in which
it was spoken may still be felt in the printed
page.</p>



<p>The tradition of Lincoln&#8217;s power as an orator
is well fortified by the great company of
contemporaries who wrote of him, as well as by
the text of his speeches, which still vibrate with
the nobility, the restrained strength, with which
he addressed himself to mighty events. Neither
before nor since his day has the West spoken
to the East with anything approaching the
majesty of his Cooper Union speech. It is
certainly a far cry from that lofty utterance to
Mr. Bryan&#8217;s defiant cross-of-gold challenge of
1896.</p>

<p>The Westerner will listen attentively to a
man he despises and has no intention of voting
for, if he speaks well; but the standards are
high. There is a death-watch that occupies
front seats at every political meeting, composed
of veterans who compare all later performances
with some speech they heard Garfield or &#8220;Dan&#8221;
Voorhees, Oliver P. Morton or John J. Ingalls
deliver before the orator spouting on the platform
was born. Nearly all the national conventions
held in the West have been marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
by memorable oratory. Colonel Robert G.
Ingersoll&#8217;s speech nominating Blaine at the Republican
convention of 1876 held at Cincinnati
(how faint that old battle-cry has become:
&#8220;Blaine, Blaine, Blaine of Maine!&#8221;) is often
cited as one of the great American orations.
&#8220;He swayed and moved and impelled and restrained
and worked in all ways with the mass
before him,&#8221; says the Chicago <i>Times</i> report,
&#8220;as if he possessed some key to the innermost
mechanism that moves the human heart, and
when he finished, his fine, frank face as calm as
when he began, the overwrought thousands
sank back in an exhaustion of unspeakable
wonder and delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even making allowance for the reporter&#8217;s
exuberance, this must have been a moving utterance,
with its dramatic close:</p>

<p>&#8220;Like an armed warrior, like a plumed
knight, James G. Blaine marched down the
halls of the American Congress and threw his
shining lance full and fair against the brazen
foreheads of the defamers of his country and
the maligners of his honor. For the Republican
party to desert this gallant leader now is as
though an army should desert their gallant
general upon the field of battle.... Gentlemen
of the convention, in the name of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
republic, the only republic that ever existed
upon this earth; in the name of all her defenders
and of all her supporters; in the name of all her
soldiers dead upon the field of battle, and in the
name of those who perished in the skeleton
clutch of famine at Andersonville and Libby,
whose sufferings he so vividly remembers, Illinois,
Illinois nominates for the next President
of this country that prince of parliamentarians,
that leader of leaders&mdash;James G. Blaine.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the fall of the same year Ingersoll delivered
at Indianapolis an address to war veterans that
is still cited for its peroration beginning: &#8220;The
past rises before me like a dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>The political barbecue, common in pioneer
days, is about extinct, though a few such gatherings
were reported in the older States of the
Middle West in the last campaign. These functions,
in the day of poor roads and few settlements,
were a means of luring voters to a meeting
with the promise of free food; it was only
by such heroic feats of cookery as the broiling
of a whole beef in a pit of coals that a crowd
could be fed. The meat was likely to be either
badly burnt, or raw, but the crowds were not
fastidious, and swigs of whiskey made it more
palatable. Those were days of plain speech
and hard hitting, and on such occasions orators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
were expected to &#8220;cut loose&#8221; and flay the enemy
unsparingly.</p>

<p>Speakers of the rabble-rouser type have
passed out, though there are still orators who
proceed to &#8220;shell the woods&#8221; and &#8220;burn the
grass&#8221; in the old style in country districts
where they are not in danger of being reported.
This, however, is full of peril, as the farmer&#8217;s
credulity is not so easily played upon as in the
old days before the R. F. D. box was planted at
his gate. The farmer is the shrewdest, the most
difficult, of auditors. He is little given to applause,
but listens meditatively, and is not
easily to be betrayed into demonstrations of
approval. The orator&#8217;s chance of scoring a
hit before an audience of country folk depends
on his ability to state his case with an appearance
of fairness and to sustain it with arguments
presented in simple, picturesque phraseology.
Nothing could be less calculated to
win the farmer&#8217;s franchise than any attempt to
&#8220;play down&#8221; to him. In old times the city
candidate sometimes donned his fishing-clothes
before venturing into country districts, but some
of the most engaging demagogues the West has
known appeared always in their finest raiment.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_198.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The Political Barbecue.</p>

<p>There has always been a considerable sprinkling
of women at big Indiana rallies and also at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
State conventions, as far back as my memory
runs; but women, I am advised, were rarely in
evidence at political meetings in the West
until Civil War times. The number who attended
meetings in 1916 was notably large,
even in States that have not yet granted general
suffrage. They are most satisfactory auditors,
quick to catch points and eagerly responsive
with applause. The West has many women
who speak exceedingly well, and the number is
steadily growing. I have never heard heckling
so cleverly parried as by a young woman who
spoke on a Chicago street corner, during the
sessions of the last Republican convention, to
a crowd of men bent upon annoying her. She
was unfailingly good-humored, and her retorts,
delivered with the utmost good nature, gradually
won the sympathy of her hearers.</p>

<p>The making of political speeches is exhausting
labor, and only the possessor of great bodily
vigor can make a long tour without a serious
drain upon his physical and nervous energy.
Mr. Bryan used to refer with delight to the
manner in which Republicans he met, unable
to pay him any other compliment, expressed
their admiration for his magnificent constitution,
which made it possible for him to speak
so constantly without injury to his health.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
The fatiguing journeys, the enforced adjustment
to the crowds of varying size in circumstances
never twice alike, the handshaking and
the conferences with local committees to which
prominent speakers must submit make speaking-tours
anything but the triumphal excursions
they appear to be to the cheering audiences.
The weary orator arrives at a town to find
that instead of snatching an hour&#8217;s rest he must
yield to the importunity of a committee intrusted
with the responsibility of showing him
the sights of the city, with probably a few brief
speeches at factories; and after a dinner, where
he will very likely be called upon to say &#8220;just
a few words,&#8221; he must ride in a procession
through the chill night before he addresses the
big meeting. One of the most successful of
Western campaigners is Thomas R. Marshall,
of Indiana, twice Mr. Wilson&#8217;s running mate
on the presidential ticket. In 1908 Mr. Marshall
was the Democratic candidate for governor
and spoke in every county in the State, avoiding
the usual partisan appeals, but preaching a
political gospel of good cheer, with the result
that he was elected by a plurality of 14,453,
while Mr. Taft won the State&#8217;s electoral vote
by a plurality of 10,731. Mr. Marshall enjoys
a wide reputation as a story-teller, both for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
humor of his narratives and the art he brings
to their recital.</p>

<p>A few dashes of local color assist in establishing
the visiting orator on terms of good-fellowship
with his audience. He will inform himself
as to the number of broom-handles or refrigerators
produced annually in the town, or the
amount of barley and buckwheat that last year
rewarded the toil of the noble husbandmen of
the county. It is equally important for him to
take counsel of the local chairman as to things
to avoid, for there are sore spots in many districts
which must be let alone or touched with a
healing hand. The tyro who prepares a speech
with the idea of giving it through a considerable
territory finds quickly that the sooner he forgets
his manuscript the better, so many are the
concessions he must make to local conditions.</p>

<p>In the campaign of 1916 the Democrats made
strenuous efforts to win the Progressive vote.
Energetic county chairmen would lure as many
Progressives as possible to the front seats at all
meetings that they might learn of the admiration
in which they were held by forward-looking
Democrats&mdash;the bond of sympathy, the common
ideals, that animated honest Democrats
and their brothers, those patriotic citizens who,
long weary of Republican indifference to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
rights of freemen, had broken the ties of a lifetime
to assert their independence. Democratic
orators, with the Progressives in mind, frequently
apostrophized Lincoln, that they might
the better contrast the vigorous, healthy Republicanism
of the &#8217;60&#8217;s with the corrupt,
odious thing the Republican party had become.
This, of course, had to be done carefully, so that
the Progressive would not experience twinges of
homesickness for his old stamping-ground.</p>

<p>There is agreement among political managers
as to the doubtful value of the &#8220;monster meetings&#8221;
that are held in large centres. With
plenty of money to spend and a thorough organization,
it is always possible to &#8220;pull off&#8221;
a big demonstration. Word passed to ward
and precinct committeemen will collect a vast
crowd for a parade adorned with fireworks.
The size and enthusiasm of these crowds is
never truly significant of party strength. One
such crowd looks very much like another, and I
am betraying no confidence in saying that its
units are often drawn from the same sources.
The participants in a procession rarely hear the
speeches at the meeting of which they are the
advertisement. When they reach the hall it
is usually filled and their further function is to
march down the aisles with bands and drum-corps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
to put the crowd in humor for the speeches.
Frequently some belated phalanx will noisily
intrude after the orator has been introduced,
and he must smile and let it be seen that he
understands perfectly that the interruption is
due to the irrepressible enthusiasm of the intelligent
voters of the grand old blank district
that has never failed to support the principles
of the grand old blank party.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory meetings are small
ones, in country districts, where one or two hundred
people of all parties gather, drawn by an
honest curiosity as to the issues. Such meetings
impose embarrassments upon the speaker, who
must accommodate manner and matter to auditors
disconcertingly close at hand, of whose
reaction to his talk he is perfectly conscious.
In an &#8220;all-day&#8221; meeting, held usually in groves
that serve as rural social centres, the farmers
remain in their automobiles drawn into line
before the speakers&#8217; stand, and listen quietly
to the programme arranged by the county chairman.
Sometimes several orators are provided
for the day; Republicans may take the morning,
the Democrats the afternoon. Here, with the
audience sitting as a jury, we have one of the
processes of democracy reduced to its simplest
terms.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>The West is attracted by statesmen who are
&#8220;human,&#8221; who impress themselves upon the
Folks by their amiability and good-fellowship.
Benjamin Harrison was recognized as one of
the ablest lawyers of the bar of his day, but he
was never a popular hero and his defeat for re-election
was attributable in large degree to his
lack of those qualities that constitute what I
have called &#8220;folksiness.&#8221; In the campaign
of 1888 General Harrison suffered much from
the charge that he was an aristocrat, and attention
was frequently called to the fact that
he was the grandson of a President. Among
other cartoons of the period there was one that
represented Harrison as a pigmy standing in
the shadow of his grandfather&#8217;s tall hat. This
was probably remembered by an Indiana politician
who called at the White House repeatedly
without being able to see the President. After
several fruitless visits the secretary said to him
one day: &#8220;The President cannot be seen.&#8221;
&#8220;My God!&#8221; exclaimed the enraged office-seeker,
&#8220;has he grown as small as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably no President has ever enjoyed
greater personal popularity than Mr. McKinley.
He would perform an act of kindness with
a graciousness that doubled its value and he
could refuse a favor without making an enemy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Former Governor Glynn of New York told me
not long ago an incident illuminative of the
qualities that endeared Mr. McKinley to his
devoted followers. Soon after his inauguration
a Democratic congressman from an Eastern
State delivered in the House a speech filled
with the bitterest abuse of the President. A
little later this member&#8217;s wife, not realizing
that a savage attack of this sort would naturally
make its author <i>persona non grata</i> at the White
House, expressed a wish to take her young
children to call on the President. The youngsters
were insistent in their demand to make the
visit and would not be denied. The offending
representative confessed his embarrassment to
Mr. Glynn, a Democratic colleague, who said
he&#8217;d &#8220;feel out&#8221; the President. Mr. McKinley,
declaring at once with the utmost good humor
that he would be delighted to receive the lady
and her children, named a day and met them
with the greatest cordiality. He planted the
baby on his desk to play, put them all at ease,
and as they left distributed among them a huge
bouquet of carnations that he had ordered
specially from the conservatory. In this connection
I am reminded of a story of Thomas B.
Reed, who once asked President Harrison to
appoint a certain constituent collector at Portland.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
The appointment went to another candidate
for the office, and when one of Reed&#8217;s
friends twitted him about his lack of influence
he remarked: &#8220;There are only two men in the
whole State of Maine who hate me: one of
them I landed in the penitentiary, and the other
one Harrison has appointed collector of the port
in my town!&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Statesmen of the &#8220;picturesque&#8221; school, who
attracted attention by their scorn of conventions,
or their raciness of speech, or for some
obsession aired on every occasion, are well-nigh
out of the picture. The West is not without its
sensitiveness, and it has found that a sockless
congressman, or one who makes himself ridiculous
by advocating foolish measures, reflects
upon the intelligence of his constituents or upon
their sense of humor, and if there is anything the
West prides itself upon it is its humor. We are
seeing fewer statesmen of the type so blithely
represented by Mr. Cannon, who enjoy in
marked degree the affections of their constituents;
who are kindly uncles to an entire district,
not to be displaced, no matter what their
shortcomings, without genuine grief. One is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
tempted far afield in pursuit of the elements of
popularity, of which the West offers abundant
material for analysis. &#8220;Dan&#8221; Voorhees, &#8220;the
tall sycamore of the Wabash,&#8221; was prominent
in Indiana politics for many years, and his fine
figure, his oratorical gifts, his sympathetic
nature and reputation for generosity endeared
him to many who had no patience with his
politics. He was so effective as an advocate
in criminal cases that the Indiana law giving
defendants the final appeal was changed so that
the State might counteract the influence of
his familiar speech, adjustable to any case,
which played upon the sympathy and magnanimity
of the jurors. Allen G. Thurman, of
Ohio, a man of higher intellectual gifts, was
similarly enshrined in the hearts of his constituency.
His bandanna was for years the
symbol of Buckeye democracy, much as &#8220;blue
jeans&#8221; expressed the rugged simplicity of the
Hoosier democracy when, in 1876, the apparel
of James D. Williams, unwisely ridiculed by the
Republicans, contributed to his election to the
governorship over General Harrison, the &#8220;kid-glove&#8221;
candidate. Kansas was much in evidence
in those years when it was so ably represented
in the Senate by the brilliant John J.
Ingalls. Ingalls&#8217;s oratory was enriched by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
fine scholarship and enlivened by a rare gift of
humor and a biting sarcasm. Once when a
Pennsylvania colleague attacked Kansas Ingalls
delivered a slashing reply. &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;Pennsylvania has produced but two
great men: Benjamin Franklin, of Massachusetts,
and Albert Gallatin, of Switzerland.&#8221;
On another occasion Voorhees of the blond
mane aroused Ingalls&#8217;s ire and the Kansan
excoriated the Hoosier in a characteristic deliverance,
an incident thus neatly epitomized
by Eugene F. Ware, (&#8220;Ironquill&#8221;), a Kansas
poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Cyclone dense,</div>
<div class="indent">Lurid air,</div>
<div class="indent">Wabash hair,</div>
<div class="verse">Hide on fence.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Nothing is better calculated to encourage
humility in young men about to enter upon a
political career than a study of the roster of
Congress for years only lightly veiled in &#8220;the
pathos of distance.&#8221; Among United States
senators from the Middle West in 1863-9 were
Lyman Trumbull, Richard J. Oglesby, and Richard
Yates, of Illinois; Henry S. Lane, Oliver P.
Morton, and Thomas A. Hendricks, of Indiana;
James Harlan and Samuel J. Kirkwood, of
Iowa; Samuel C. Pomeroy and James H. Lane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
of Kansas; Zachariah Chandler and Jacob M.
Howard, of Michigan; Alexander Ramsey and
Daniel S. Norton, of Minnesota; Benjamin F.
Wade and John Sherman, of Ohio.</p>

<p>In the lower house sat Elihu B. Washburne,
Owen Lovejoy, and William R. Morrison, of
Illinois; Schuyler Colfax, George W. Julian,
Daniel W. Voorhees, William S. Holman, and
Godlove S. Orth, of Indiana; William B. Allison,
Josiah B. Grinnell, John A. Kasson, and
James F. Wilson, of Iowa; James A. Garfield,
Rutherford B. Hayes, and Robert C. Schenck,
of Ohio. In the same group of States in the
&#8217;80&#8217;s we find David Davis, John A. Logan,
Joseph E. McDonald, Benjamin Harrison,
Thomas W. Ferry, Henry P. Baldwin, William
Windom, Samuel J. R. McMillan, Algernon S.
Paddock, Alvin Saunders, M. H. Carpenter,
John J. Ingalls, and Preston B. Plumb, all
senators in Congress. In this same period the
Ohio delegation in the lower house included
Benjamin Butterworth, A. J. Warner, Thomas
Ewing, Charles Foster, Frank H. Hurd, J. Warren
Keifer, and William McKinley.</p>

<p>How many students in the high schools and
colleges of these States would recognize any
considerable number of these names or have any
idea of the nature of the public service these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
men performed? To be sure, three representatives
in Congress from Ohio in the years indicated,
and one senator from Indiana, reached
the White House; but at least two-thirds of
the others enjoyed a wide reputation, either
as politicians or statesmen or as both. In the
years preceding the Civil War the West certainly
did not lack leadership, nor did all who
rendered valuable service attain conspicuous
place. For example, George W. Julian, an
ardent foe of slavery, a member of Congress,
and in 1852 a candidate for Vice-President on
the Free Soil ticket, was a political idealist, independent
and courageous, and with the ability
to express his opinions tersely and effectively.</p>

<p>It is always hazardous to compare the statesmen
of one period with those of another, and
veteran observers whose judgments must be
treated with respect insist that the men I have
mentioned were not popularly regarded in their
day as the possessors of unusual abilities.
Most of these men were prominent in my youth,
and in some cases were still important factors
when I attained my majority, and somehow
they seem to &#8220;mass&#8221; as their successors do not.
The fierce passions aroused in the Middle West
by the slavery issue undoubtedly brought into
the political arena men who in calmer times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
would have remained contentedly in private
life. The restriction of slavery and the preservation
of the Union were concrete issues that
awakened a moral fervor not since apparent in
our politics. Groups of people are constantly
at work in the social field, to improve municipal
government, or to place State politics upon a
higher plane; but these movements occasion
only slight tremors in contrast with the quaking
of the earth through the free-soil agitation,
Civil War, and reconstruction.</p>

<p>The men I have mentioned were, generally
speaking, poor men, and the next generation
found it much more comfortable and profitable
to practise law or engage in business than to
enter politics. I am grieved by my inability
to offer substantial proof that ideals of public
service in the Western provinces are higher than
they were fifty or twenty years ago. I record
my opinion that they are not, and that we are
less ably served in the Congress than formerly,
frankly to invite criticism; for these times call
for a great searching for the weaknesses of democracy
and, if the best talent is not finding
its way into the lawmaking, administrative, and
judicial branches of our State and federal governments,
an obligation rests upon every citizen
to find the reason and supply the remedy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>No Westerner who is devoted to the best interests
of his country will encourage the belief
that there is any real hostility between East
and West, or that the West is incapable of viewing
social and political movements in the light
of reason and experience. It stood steadfastly
against the extension of slavery and for the
Union through years of fiery trial, and its
leaders expressed the national thought and held
the lines firm against opposition, concealed and
open, that was kept down only by ceaseless
vigilance. Even in times of financial stress it
refused to hearken to the cry of the demagogue,
and Greenbackism died, just as later Populism
died. More significant was the failure of Mr.
Bryan to win the support of the West that was
essential to his success in three campaigns. We
may say that it was a narrow escape, and that
the West was responsible for a serious menace
and a peril not too easily averted, but Mr.
Bryan precipitated a storm that was bound to
break and that left the air clearer. He &#8220;threw
a scare&#8221; into the country just when it needed
to be aroused, and some of his admonitions have
borne good fruit on soil least friendly to him.</p>

<p>The West likes to be &#8220;preached at,&#8221; and it
admires a courageous evangelist even when it
declines his invitation to the mourners&#8217; bench.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
The West liked and still likes Mr. Roosevelt,
and no other American can so instantly gain the
ear of the West as he. In my pilgrimages of
the past year nothing has been more surprising
than the change of tone with reference to the
former President among Western Republicans,
who declared in 1912 and reiterated in 1916 that
never, never again would they countenance him.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>One may find in the Mississippi valley, as in
the Connecticut valley or anywhere else in
America, just about what one wishes to find.
A New England correspondent complains with
some bitterness of the political conservatism he
encountered in a journey through the West;
he had expected to find radicalism everywhere
rampant, and was disappointed that he was
unable to substantiate his preconceived impression
by actual contacts with the people.</p>

<p>If I may delicately suggest the point without
making too great a concession, the West is really
quite human. It has its own &#8220;slant&#8221;&mdash;its
tastes and preferences that differ in ways from
those of the East, the South, or the farther
West; and radicals are distributed through the
corn belt in about the same proportion as elsewhere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
The bread-and-butter Western Folks
are pretty sensible, taken in the long run, and
not at all anxious to pull down the social pillars
just to make a noise. They will impiously carve
them a little&mdash;yes, and occasionally stick an incongruous
patch on the wall of the sanctuary
of democracy; but they are never wilfully destructive.
And it cannot be denied that some
of their architectural and decorative efforts have
improved the original design. The West has
saved other sections a good deal of trouble by
boldly experimenting with devices it had
&#8220;thought up&#8221; amid the free airs of the plains;
but the West, no more than the East, will give
storage to a contrivance that has been proved
worthless.</p>

<p>The vindictive spirit that was very marked in
the Western attitude toward the railroads for
many years was not a gratuitous and unfounded
hatred of corporations, but had a real basis in
discriminations that touched vitally the life
of the farmer and the struggling towns to which
he carried his products. The railroads were the
only corporations the West knew before the
great industrial development. A railroad represented
&#8220;capital,&#8221; and &#8220;capital&#8221; was therefore
a thing to chastise whenever opportunity
offered. It has been said in bitterness of late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
that the hostile legislation demanded by the
West &#8220;ruined the railroads.&#8221; This is not a
subject for discussion here, but it can hardly be
denied that the railroads invited the war that
was made upon them by injustices and discriminations
of which the obscure shipper had a
right to complain. The antagonism to railroads
inspired a great deal of radicalism aimed
at capital generally, and &#8220;corporate greed,&#8221;
&#8220;the encroachments of capital,&#8221; &#8220;the money
devils of Wall Street,&#8221; and &#8220;special privilege&#8221;
burned fiercely in our political terminology.
Our experiment with government control as a
war measure has, of course, given a new twist
to the whole transportation problem.</p>

<p>The West likes to play with novelties. It has
been hospitable to such devices as the initiative,
the referendum, and the recall, multiplied
agencies for State supervision in many directions,
and it has shown in general a confidence in automatic
machinery popularly designed to correct
all evils. The West probably infected the rest
of the country with the fallacy that the passing
of a law is a complete transaction without
reference to its enforcement, and Western
statute-books are littered with legislation often
frivolous or ill considered. There has, however,
been a marked reaction and the demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
is rather for less legislation and better administration.
A Western governor said to me despairingly
that his State is &#8220;commissioned&#8221; to
death, and that he is constantly embarrassed
by the difficulty of persuading competent men to
accept places on his many bipartisan regulative
boards.</p>

<p>There is a virtue in our very size as a nation
and the multiplicity of interests represented by
the one hundred million that make it possible
for the majority to watch, as from a huge amphitheatre,
the experiments in some particular
arena. A new agrarian movement that originated
in North Dakota in 1915 has attained formidable
proportions. The Non-Partisan League
(it is really a political party) seems to have
sprung full-panoplied from the Equity Society,
and is a successor of the Farmers&#8217; Alliance and
Populism. The despised middleman was the
first object of its animosity, and it began with a
comprehensive programme of State-owned elevators
and flour-mills, packing-houses and cold-storage
plants. The League carried North
Dakota in 1916, electing a governor who immediately
vetoed a bill providing for a State-owned
terminal elevator because the League leaders
&#8220;raised their sights&#8221; as soon as they got into
the trenches. They demanded unlimited bonding-power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
and a complete new programme embodying
a radical form of State socialism.
&#8220;Class struggle,&#8221; says Mr. Elmer T. Peterson,
an authority on the League&#8217;s history, &#8220;is the
key-note of its propaganda.&#8221; The student of
current political tendencies will do well to keep
an eye on the League, as it has gained a strong
foothold in the Northwest, and the co-operative
features of its platform satisfy an old craving
of the farmer for State assistance in the management
of his business.</p>

<p>The League is now thoroughly organized in
the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana,
Idaho, and Colorado and is actively at work
in Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.
Governor Burnquist of Minnesota addressed a
letter to its executive secretary during the
primary campaign last summer in which he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the time of our entrance into the European conflict
your organization condemned our government for
entering the war. When it became evident that this
course would result in disaster for their organization they
changed their course and made an eleventh-hour claim to
pure loyalty, but notwithstanding this claim the National
Non-Partisan League is a party of discontent. It has
drawn to it the pro-German element of our State. Its
leaders have been closely connected with the lawless
I. W. W. and with Red Socialists. Pacifists and peace
advocates whose doctrines are of benefit to Germany are
among their number.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>The League&#8217;s activities in obstructing conscription
and other war measures have been
the subject of investigation by military and
civil authorities. The <i>Leader</i>, the official organ
of the party, recently printed, heavily capitalized,
this sentiment, &#8220;The Government of the
People by the Rascals for the Rich,&#8221; as the key-note
of its hostility to America&#8217;s participation
in the war.</p>

<p>The West is greatly given to sober second
thoughts. Hospitable to new ideas as it has
proved itself to be, it will stop short of a leap
in the dark. There is a point at which it becomes
extremely conservative. It will run like
a frightened rabbit from some change which it
has encouraged. But the West has a passion
for social justice, and is willing to make sacrifices
to gain it. The coming of the war found
this its chief concern, not under the guidance of
feverish agitators but from a sense that democracy,
to fulfil its destiny, must make the
conditions of life happy and comfortable for
the great body of the people. It is not the &#8220;pee-pul&#8221;
of the demagogue who are to be reckoned
with in the immediate future of Western political
expression, but an intelligent, earnest citizenry,
anxious to view American needs with the new
vision compelled by the world struggle in the
defense of democracy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>The rights and privileges of citizenship long
enjoyed by women of certain Western States
ceased to be a vagary of the untutored wilds
when last year New York adopted a constitutional
amendment granting women the ballot.
The fight for a federal amendment was won in
the House last winter by a narrow margin, but
at this writing the matter is still pending in the
Senate. Many of the old arguments against
the enfranchisement of women have been pretty
effectually disposed of in States that were pioneers
in general suffrage. I lived for three years
in Colorado without being conscious of any of
those disturbances to domesticity that we used
to be told would follow if women were projected
into politics. I can testify that a male voter
may register and cast his ballot without any feeling
that the women he encounters as he performs
these exalted duties have relinquished
any of the ancient prerogatives of their womanhood.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the experience of suffrage
States to justify a suspicion that women are
friendlier to radical movements than men, but
much to sustain the assertion that they take
their politics seriously and are as intelligent in
the exercise of the ballot as male voters. The
old notion that the enfranchisement of women
would double the vote without changing results<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
is another fallacy; I am disposed to think them
more independent than their male fellow citizens
and less likely to submit meekly to party dictation.</p>

<p>In practically every American court- and State-house
and city hall there are women holding
responsible clerical positions, and, if the keeping
of important records may be intrusted to women,
the task of defending their exclusion from elective
offices is one that I confess to be beyond
my powers. Nor is there anything shocking in
the presence of a woman on the floor of a legislative
body. Montana sent a woman to the
national Congress, and already her fellow members
hear her voice without perturbation. Mrs.
Agnes Riddle, a member of the Colorado Senate,
is a real contributor, I shall not scruple to say,
to the intelligence and wisdom of that body.
Mrs. Riddle, apart from being a stateswoman,
manages a dairy to its utmost details, and during
the session answers the roll-call after doing a
pretty full day&#8217;s work on her farm. The schools
of Colorado are admirably conducted by Mrs.
C. C. Bradford, who has thrice been re-elected
superintendent of public instruction. The deputy
attorney-general of Colorado, Miss Clara
Ruth Mozzor, sits at her desk as composedly as
though she were not the first woman to gain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
this political and professional recognition in the
Centennial Commonwealth. I am moved to
ask whether we shall not find for the enfranchised
woman who becomes active in public affairs
some more felicitous and gallant term than
politician&mdash;a word much soiled from long application
to the corrupt male, and perhaps the
Federation of Women&#8217;s Clubs will assist in
this matter.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>As the saying became trite, almost before
news of our entrance into the world war had
reached the nation&#8217;s farthest borders, that we
should emerge from the conflict a new and a
very different America, it becomes of interest
to keep in mind the manner and the spirit in
which we entered into the mighty struggle. It
was not merely in the mind of people everywhere,
on the 2d of April, 1917, that the nation was face
to face with a contest that would tax its powers
to the utmost, but that our internal affairs would
be subjected to serious trial, and that parties
and party policies would inevitably experience
changes of greatest moment before another general
election. When this is read the congressional
campaign will be gathering headway;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
as I write, public attention is turning, rather
impatiently it must be said, to the prospects of
a campaign that is likely to pursue its course to
the accompaniment of booming cannon overseas.
How much the conduct of the war by
the administration in power will figure in the
pending contest is not yet apparent; but as
the rapid succession of events following Mr.
Wilson&#8217;s second inauguration have dimmed
the issues of 1916, it may be well to summarize
the respective attitudes of the two major
parties two years ago to establish a point of
orientation.</p>

<p>It was the chief Republican contention that
the Democratic administration had failed to
preserve the national honor and security in its
dealings with Mexico and Germany. As political
platforms are soon forgotten, it may be of
interest to reproduce this paragraph of the
Republican declaration of 1916:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The present administration has destroyed our influence
abroad and humiliated us in our own eyes. The Republican
party believes that a firm, consistent, and courageous
foreign policy, always maintained by Republican Presidents
in accordance with American traditions, is the best,
as it is the only true way to preserve our peace and restore
us to our rightful place among the nations. We believe
in the pacific settlement of international disputes
and favor the establishment of a world court for that
purpose.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>The concluding sentence is open to the criticism
that it weakens what precedes it; but the
Mexican plank, after denouncing &#8220;the indefensible
methods of interference employed by
this administration in the internal affairs of
Mexico,&#8221; promises to &#8220;our citizens on and near
our border, and to those in Mexico, wherever
they may be found, adequate and absolute
protection in their lives, liberty, and property.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Pershing had launched his punitive
expedition on Mexican soil in March, and the
Democratic platform adopted at St. Louis in
June justifies this move; but it goes on to add:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Intervention, implying as it does military subjugation,
is revolting to the people of the United States, notwithstanding
the provocation to that course has been great,
and should be resorted to, if at all, only as a last resort.
The stubborn resistance of the President and his advisers
to every demand and suggestion to enter upon it, is
creditable alike to them and to the people in whose name
he speaks.</p>
</div>

<p>As to Germany, this paragraph of the Democratic
platform might almost have been written
into President Wilson&#8217;s message to Congress of
April 2, 1917, so clearly does it set forth the
spirit in which America entered into the war:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We believe that every people has the right to choose
the sovereignty under which it shall live; that the small
states of the world have a right to enjoy from other nations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the same respect for their sovereignty and for their
territorial integrity that great and powerful nations expect
and insist upon, and that the world has a right to
be free from every disturbance of its peace that has its
origin in aggression or disregard of the rights of peoples
and nations, and we believe that the time has come when
it is the duty of the United States to join with the other
nations of the world in any feasible association that will
effectively serve these principles, to maintain inviolate
the complete security of the highway of the seas for the
common and unhindered use of all nations.</p>
</div>

<p>The impression was very general in the East
that the West was apathetic or indifferent both
as to the irresponsible and hostile acts of Mexicans
and the growing insolence of the Imperial
German Government with reference to American
rights on the seas. Any such assumption was
unfair at the time, and has since been disproved
by the promptness and vigor with which the
West responded to the call to arms. But the
West had no intention of being stampeded. A
Democratic President whose intellectual processes
and manner of speech were radically different
from those at least of his immediate predecessors,
was exercising a Lincoln-like patience
in his efforts to keep the country out of war.
From the time the Mexican situation became
threatening one might meet anywhere in the
West Republicans who thought that the honor
and security of the nation were being trifled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
with; that the President&#8217;s course was inconsistent
and vacillating; and even that we
should have whipped Mexico into subjection
and maintained an army on her soil until a
stable government had been established. These
views were expressed in many parts of the West
by men of influence in Republican councils, and
there were Democrats who held like opinions.</p>

<p>The Republicans were beset by two great
difficulties when the national convention met.
The first of these was to win back the Progressives
who had broken with the party and contributed
to the defeat of Mr. Taft in 1912; the
second was the definition of a concrete policy
touching Germany and Mexico that would appeal
to the patriotic voter, without going the
length of threatening war. The standpatters
were in no humor to make concessions to the
Progressives, who, in another part of Chicago,
were unwilling to receive the olive-branch except
on their own terms. Denied the joy of
Mr. Roosevelt&#8217;s enlivening presence to create a
high moment, the spectators were aware of his
ability to add to the general gloom by his telegram
suggesting Senator Lodge as a compromise
candidate acceptable to the Progressives. The
speculatively inclined may wonder what would
have happened if in one of the dreary hours of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
waiting Colonel Roosevelt had walked upon
the platform and addressed the convention.
Again, those who have leisure for political solitaire
may indulge in reflections as to whether
Senator Lodge would not have appealed to the
West quite as strongly as Mr. Hughes. The
West, presumably, was not interested in Senator
Lodge, though I timidly suggest that if a New
Jersey candidate can be elected and re-elected
with the aid of the West, Massachusetts need not
so modestly hang in the background when a
national convention orders the roll-call of the
States for favorite sons.</p>

<p>There was little question at any time from
the hour the convention opened that Mr.
Hughes would be the nominee, and I believe
it is a fair statement that he was the candidate
the Democrats feared most. The country had
formed a good opinion of him as a man of independence
and courage, and, having strictly observed
the silence enjoined by his position on
the bench during the Republican family quarrel
of four years earlier, he was looked upon as a
candidate well fitted to rally the Progressives
and lead a united party to victory.</p>

<p>The West waited and listened. While it had
seemed a &#8220;safe play&#8221; for the Republicans to
attack the Democratic administration for its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
course with Mexico and Germany, the presentation
of the case to the people was attended with
serious embarrassments. The obvious alternative
of Mr. Wilson&#8217;s policy was war. The
West was not at all anxious for war; it certainly
did not want two wars. If war could be averted
by negotiation the West was in a mood to be
satisfied with that solution. Republican campaigners
were aware of the danger of arraigning
the administration for not going to war and
contented themselves with attacks upon what
they declared to be a shifty and wobbly policy.
The West&#8217;s sense of fair play was, I think, roused
by the vast amount of destructive criticism
launched against the administration unaccompanied
by any constructive programme. The
President had grown in public respect and confidence;
the West had seen and heard him since
he became a national figure, and he did not
look or talk like a man who would out of sheer
contrariness trifle with the national security
and honor. It may be said with truth that the
average Western Democrat was not &#8220;keen&#8221;
about Mr. Wilson when he first loomed as a
presidential possibility. I heard a good deal
of discussion by Western Democrats of Mr.
Wilson&#8217;s availability in 1910-11, and he was
not looked upon with favor. He was &#8220;different&#8221;;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
he didn&#8217;t invoke the Democratic gods
in the old familiar phraseology, and he was
suspected of entertaining narrow views as to
&#8220;spoils,&#8221; such as caused so much heartache
among the truly loyal in Mr. Cleveland&#8217;s two administrations.</p>

<p>The Democratic campaign slogan, &#8220;He has
kept us out of war!&#8221; was not met with the
definite challenge that he should have got us into
war. Jingoism was well muffled. What passed
for apathy was really a deep concern as to the
outcome of our pressing international difficulties,
an anxiety to weigh the points at issue
soberly. Western managers constantly warned
visiting orators to beware of &#8220;abusing the opposition,&#8221;
as there were men and women of all
political faiths in the audiences. Both sides
were timid where the German vote was concerned,
the Democrats alarmed lest the &#8220;strict
accountability&#8221; attitude of the President toward
the Imperial German Government would damage
the party&#8217;s chances, and the Republicans
embarrassed by the danger of openly appealing
to the hyphenates when the Republican campaign
turned upon an arraignment of the President
for not dealing drastically enough with
German encroachment upon American rights.
In view of the mighty sweep of events since the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
election, all this seems tame and puerile, and
reminds us that there is a vast amount of punk
in politics.</p>

<p>In the West there are no indications that an
effect of the war will be to awaken new radical
movements or strengthen tendencies that were
apparent before America sounded the call to
arms. I have dwelt upon the sobriety with
which the West approached the election of 1916
merely as an emphasis of this. We shall have
once more a &#8220;soldier vote&#8221; to reckon with in
our politics, and the effect of their participation
in the world struggle upon the young men
who have crossed the sea to fight for democracy
is an interesting matter for speculation. One
thing certain is that the war has dealt the
greatest blow ever administered to American
sectionalism. We were prone for years to
consider our national life in a local spirit, and
the political parties expended much energy
in attempts to reconcile the demands and needs
of one division of the States with those of another.
The prolonged debate of the tariff as
a partisan issue is a noteworthy instance of
this. The farmer, the industrial laborer, the
capitalist have all been the objects of special
consideration. One argument had to be prepared
for the cotton-grower in the South;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
another for the New England mill-hands who
spun his product; still another for the mill-owner.
The farm-hand and the mechanic in
the neighboring manufacturing town had to
be reached by different lines of reasoning. Our
statesmanship, East and West, has been of the
knot-hole variety&mdash;rarely has a man risen to the
top of the fence for a broad view of the whole
field. What will be acceptable to the South?
What does the West want? We have had this
sort of thing through many years, both as to
national policies and as to candidates for the
presidency, and its effect has been to prevent
the development of sound national policies.</p>

<p>The Republican party has addressed itself
energetically to the business of reorganization.
The national committee met at St. Louis in
February to choose a new chairman in place of
Mr. William R. Willcox, and the contest for
this important position was not without its
significance. The standpatters yielded under
pressure, and after a forty-eight-hour deadlock
the election of Mr. Will H. Hays, of Indiana,
assured a hospitable open-door policy toward
all prodigals. In 1916 Mr. Hays, as chairman
of the Republican State committee, carried Indiana
against heavy odds and established himself
as one of the ablest political managers the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
West has known. As the country is likely to
hear a good deal of him in the next two years,
I may note that he is a man of education, high-minded,
resourceful, endowed with prodigious
energy and trained and tested executive ability.
A lawyer in a town of five thousand people, he
served his political apprenticeship in all capacities
from precinct committeeman to the State
chairmanship. Mr. Hays organized and was
the first chairman of the Indiana State Council
of Defense, and made it a thoroughly effective
instrument for the co-ordination of the State&#8217;s
war resources and the diffusion of an ardent
patriotism. Indeed the methods of the Indiana
Council were so admirable that they were
adopted by several other States. It is in the
blood of all Hoosiers to suspect partisan motives
where none exists, but it is to Mr. Hays&#8217;s
credit that he directed Indiana&#8217;s war work, until
he resigned to accept the national chairmanship,
with the support and to the satisfaction
of every loyal citizen without respect to party.
Mr. Hays is essentially a Westerner, with the
original Wabash tang; and his humor and a
knack of coining memorable phrases are not
the least important items of his equipment for
politics. He is frank and outspoken, with no
affectations of mystery, and as his methods are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
conciliatory and assimilative the chances are
excellent for a Republican rejuvenation.</p>

<p>The burden of prosecuting the war to a conclusive
peace that shall realize the American
aims repeatedly set forth by President Wilson is
upon the Democratic administration. The West
awaits with the same seriousness with which it
pondered the problems of 1916 the definition
of new issues touching vitally our social, industrial,
and financial affairs, and our relations
with other nations, that will press for attention
the instant the last shot is fired. In the mid-summer
of 1918 only the most venturesome
political prophets are predicting either the
issues or the leaders of 1920. Events which it
is impossible to forecast will create issues and
possibly lift up new leaders not now prominent
in national politics. A successful conclusion
of the war before the national conventions meet
two years hence would give President Wilson
and his party an enormous prestige. On the
other hand, if the war should be prolonged we
shall witness inevitably the development of a
sentiment for change based upon public anxiety
to hasten the day of peace. These things are
on the knees of the gods.</p>

<p>In both parties there is to-day a melancholy
deficiency of presidential timber. It cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
be denied that Republican hopes, very generally,
are centred in Mr. Roosevelt; this is
clearly apparent throughout the West. In the
Democratic State convention held at Indianapolis,
June 18, tumultuous enthusiasm was
awakened by the chairman, former Governor
Samuel M. Ralston, who boldly declared for
Wilson in 1920&mdash;the first utterance of the
kind before any body of like representative
character. However, the immediate business
of the nation is to win the war, and there is evident
in the West no disposition to suffer this predominating
issue to be obscured by partisanship.
Indeed since America took up arms
nothing has been more marked in the Western
States than the sinking of partisanship in a
whole-hearted support of the government and
a generous response to all the demands of the
war. In meetings called in aid of war causes
Democrats and Republicans have vied with
each other in protestations of loyalty to the
government. I know of no exception to the
rule that every request from Washington has
been met splendidly by Republican State governors.
Indeed, there has been a lively rivalry
among Middle Western States to exceed the
prescribed quotas of dollars and men.</p>

<p>Already an effect of the war has been a closer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
knitting together of States and sections, a
contemplation of wider horizons. It is inevitable
that we shall be brought, East and West,
North and South, to the realization of a new
national consciousness that has long been the
imperative need of our politics. And in all the
impending changes, readjustments, and conciliations
the country may look for hearty co-operation
to a West grown amazingly conservative
and capable of astonishing manifestations
of independence.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">MUCH water has flowed under the
bridge since these papers were undertaken,
and I cheerfully confess that
in the course of the year I have learned a great
deal about the West. My observations began
at Denver when the land was still at peace,
and continued through the hour of the momentous
decision and the subsequent months of
preparation. The West is a place of moods
and its changes of spirit are sometimes puzzling.
The violence has gone out of us; we went
upon a war footing with a minimum amount of
noise and gesticulation. Deeply preoccupied
with other matters, the West was annoyed that
the Kaiser should so stupidly make it necessary
for the American Republic to give him a thrashing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
but as the thing had to be done the West
addressed itself to the job with a grim determination
to do it thoroughly.</p>

<p>We heard, after the election of 1916, that the
result was an indication of the West&#8217;s indifference
to the national danger; that the Middle
Western people could not be interested in a
war on the farther side of the Atlantic and
would suffer any indignities rather than send
their sons to fight in Europe. It was charged
in some quarters that the West had lost its
&#8220;pep&#8221;; that the fibre had softened; that the
children and the grandchildren of &#8220;Lincoln&#8217;s
men&#8221; were insensible to the national danger;
and that thoughts of a bombardment of New
York or San Francisco were not disturbing to a
people remote from the sea. I am moved to
remark that we of the West are less disposed to
encourage the idea that we are a people apart
than our friends to the eastward who often seem
anxious to force this attitude upon us. We like
our West and may boast and strut a little, but
any intimation that we are not loyal citizens of
the American Republic, jealous of its honor and
security and responsive to its every call upon
our patriotism and generosity, arouses our indignation.</p>

<p>Many of us were favored in the first years of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
the war with letters from Eastern friends anxious
to enlighten us as to America&#8217;s danger
and her duty with respect to the needs of the
sufferers in the wake of battle. On a day when
I received a communication from New York
asking &#8220;whether nothing could be done in
Indiana to rouse the people to the sore need of
France,&#8221; a committee for French relief had just
closed a week&#8217;s campaign with a fund of $17,000,
collected over the State in small sums and contributed
very largely by school children. The
Millers&#8217; Belgian Relief movement, initiated in
the fall of 1914 by Mr. William C. Edgar, of
Minneapolis, publisher of <i>The Northwestern
Miller</i>, affords a noteworthy instance of the
West&#8217;s response to appeals in behalf of the
people in the trampled kingdom. A call was
issued November 4 for 45,000 barrels of flour,
but 70,000 barrels were contributed; and this
cargo was augmented by substantial gifts of
blankets, clothing for women and children,
and condensed milk. These supplies were distributed
in Belgium under Mr. Edgar&#8217;s personal
direction, in co-operation with Mr. Herbert
C. Hoover, chairman of the Commission
for the Relief of Belgium.</p>

<p>Many Westerners were fighting under the
British and French flags, or were serving in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
French ambulance service before our entrance
into the war, and the opening of the officers&#8217;
training-camps in 1917 found young Westerners
of the best type clamoring for admission. The
Western colleges and universities cannot be too
strongly praised for the patriotic fervor with
which they met the crisis. One president said
that if necessary he would nail up the doors
of his college until the war was over. The eagerness
to serve is indicated in the Regular Army
enlistments for the period from June to December,
1917, in which practically all of the Middle
Western States doubled and tripled the
quota fixed by the War Department; and any
assumption that patriotism diminishes the
farther we penetrate into the interior falls before
the showing of Colorado, whose response
to a call for 1,598 men was answered by 3,793;
and Utah multiplied her quota by 5 and Montana
by 7. This takes no account of men who,
in the period indicated, entered training-camps,
or of naval and marine enlistments, or of the
National Guard or the selective draft. More
completely than ever before the West is merged
into the nation. The situation when war was
declared is comparable to that of householders,
long engrossed with their domestic affairs and
heeding little the needs of the community,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
who are brought to the street by a common peril
and confer soberly as to ways and means of
meeting it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The West,&#8221; an Eastern critic complains,
&#8220;appears always to be demanding something!&#8221;
The idea of the West as an Oliver Twist with
a plate insistently extended pleases me and I
am unable to meet it with any plausible refutation.
The West has always wanted and it will
continue to want and to ask for a great many
things; we may only pray that it will more and
more hammer upon the federal counter, not for
appropriations but for things of value for the
whole. &#8220;We will try anything once!&#8221; This
for long was more or less the Western attitude
in politics, but we seem to have escaped from
it; and the war, with its enormous demands
upon our resources, its revelation of national
weaknesses, caused a prompt cleaning of the
slate of old, unfinished business to await the outcome.</p>

<p>It is an element of strength in a democracy
that its political and social necessities are continuing;
there is no point of rest. Obstacles,
differences, criticism are all a necessary part
of the eternal struggle toward perfection. What
was impossible yesterday is achieved to-day and
may be abandoned to-morrow. Democracy, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
we have thus far practised it, is a series of experiments,
a quest.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The enormous industrial development of the
Middle West was a thing undreamed of by the
pioneers, whose chief concern was with the soil;
there was no way of anticipating the economic
changes that have been forced upon attention
by the growth of cities and States. Minnesota
had been a State thirteen years when in
1871 Proctor Knott, in a speech in Congress,
ridiculed the then unknown name of Duluth:
&#8220;The word fell upon my ear with a peculiar and
indescribable charm, like the gentle murmur of
a low fountain stealing forth in the midst of
roses, or the soft, sweet accent of an angel&#8217;s
whisper in the bright, joyous dream of sleeping
innocence.&#8221; And yet Duluth has become indeed
a zenith city of the saltless seas, and the
manufactured products of Minnesota have an
annual value approximating $500,000,000.</p>

<p>The first artisans, the blacksmiths and wagon-makers,
and the women weaving cloth and
fashioning the garments for their families in
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri, never
dreamed that the manufactures of these States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
alone would attain a value of $5,500,000,000,
approximately a fifth of the nation&#8217;s total. The
original social and economic structure was not
prepared for this mighty growth. States in
which the soil was tilled almost wholly by the
owners of the land were unexpectedly confronted
with social and economic questions foreign to all
their experience. Rural legislators were called
upon to deal with questions of which they had
only the most imperfect understanding. They
were bewildered to find the towns nearest them,
which had been only trading centres for the
farmer, asking for legislation touching working
hours, housing, and child labor, and for modifications
of local government made necessary by
growth and radical changes in social conditions.
I remember my surprise to find not long ago
that a small town I had known all my life had
become an industrial centre where the citizens
were gravely discussing their responsibilities to
the laborers who had suddenly been added to
the population.</p>

<p>The preponderating element in the original
occupation of the Middle Western States was
American, derived from the older States; and
the precipitation into the Mississippi valley industrial
centres of great bodies of foreigners,
many of them only vaguely aware of the purposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
and methods of democracy, added an element
of confusion and peril to State and national
politics. The perplexities and dangers
of municipal government were multiplied in the
larger cities by the injection into the electorate
of the hordes from overseas that poured into
States whose government and laws had been
fashioned to meet the needs of a homogeneous
people who lived close to the soil.</p>

<p>The war that has emphasized so many needs
and dangers has sharply accentuated the growing
power of labor. Certain manifestations of
this may no longer be viewed in the light of
local disturbances and agitations but with an
eye upon impending world changes. Whatever
the questions of social and economic reconstruction
that Europe must face, they will be
hardly less acutely presented in America; and
these matters are being discussed in the West
with a reassuring sobriety. The Industrial
Workers of the World has widely advertised itself
by its lawlessness, in recent years, and its
obstructive tactics with respect to America&#8217;s
preparations for war have focussed attention
upon it as an organization utterly inconsonant
with American institutions. An arresting incident
of recent years was the trial, in 1912, in
the United States Court for the District of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
Indiana, of forty-two officers and members of
the International Association of Structural Iron
Workers for the dynamiting of buildings and
bridges throughout the country. The trial
lasted three months, and the disclosures, pointing
to a thoroughly organized conspiracy of destruction,
were of the most startling character.
Thirty-eight of the defendants were convicted.
The influence of labor in the great industrial
States of the West is very great, and not a negligible
factor in the politics of the immediate
future. What industrial labor has gained has
been through constant pressure of its organizations;
and yet the changes of the past fifty years
have been so gradual as to present, in the retrospect,
the appearance of an evolution.</p>

<p>There is little to support an assumption that
the West in these critical hours will not take
counsel of reason; and it is an interesting circumstance
that the West has just now no one
who may be pointed to as its spokesman. No
one is speaking for the West; the West has
learned to think and to speak for itself. &#8220;Organized
emotion&#8221; (I believe the phrase is
President Lowell&#8217;s) may again become a power
for mischief in these plains that lend so amiable
an ear to the orator; but the new seriousness of
which I have attempted to give some hint in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
the progress of these papers, and the increasing
political independence of the Western people,
encourage the belief that whatever lies before
us in the way of momentous change, the West
will not be led or driven to ill-considered action.</p>

<p>In spite of many signs of a drift toward social
democracy, individualism is still the dominant
&#8220;note&#8221; in these Middle Western States, apart
from the industrial centres where socialism has
indisputably made great headway. It may be
that American political and social phenomena
are best observed in States whose earliest settlement
is so recent as to form a background for
contrast. We have still markedly in the Mississippi
valley the individualistic point of view of
the pioneer who thought out his problems alone
and was restrained by pride from confessing his
needs to his neighbors. In a region where
capital has been most bitterly assaulted it has
been more particularly in the pursuit of redress
for local grievances. The agrarian attacks upon
railroads are an instance of this. The farmer
wants quick and cheap access to markets, and
he favors co-operative elevators because he has
felt for years that the middleman poured too
many grains out of the bushel for his services.
In so far as the farmer&#8217;s relations with the State
are concerned, he has received from the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
a great many things for which, broadly
speaking, he has not asked, notably in the development
of a greater efficiency of method
and a widening of social horizons.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When the New Englander, the Southeasterner,
and the Pennsylvanian met in the Ohio valley
they spoke a common language and were animated
by common aims. Their differences
were readily reconcilable; Southern sentiment
caused tension in the Civil War period and was
recognizable in politics through reconstruction
and later, but it was possible for one to be
classed as a Southern sympathizer or even to
bear the opprobrious epithet of copperhead
without having his fundamental Americanism
questioned. Counties through this belt of
States were named for American heroes and
statesmen&mdash;Washington, Franklin, Jefferson,
Hamilton, Marion, Clark, Perry&mdash;varied by
French and Indian names that tinkle musically
along lakes and rivers.</p>

<p>There was never any doubt in the early days
that all who came were quickly assimilated into
the body of the republic, and certainly there
was no fear that any conceivable situation could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
ever cause the loyalty of the newly adopted
citizen to be questioned. The soil was too
young in the days of Knownothingism and the
body of the population too soundly American
for the West to be greatly roused by that
movement. Nevertheless we have had in the
West as elsewhere the political recognition of
the race group&mdash;a particular consideration for
the Irish vote or the German vote, and in the
Northwestern States for the Scandinavian. The
political &#8220;bosses&#8221; were not slow to throw their
lines around the increasing race groups with a
view to control and manipulation. Our political
platforms frequently expressed &#8220;sympathy with
the Irish people in their struggle for home rule,&#8221;
and it had always been considered &#8220;good politics&#8221;
to recognize the Irish and the Germans in
party nominations.</p>

<p>Following Germany&#8217;s first hostile acts against
American life and property, through the long
months of waiting in which America hoped for a
continuation of neutrality, we became conscious
that the point of view held by citizens of American
stock differed greatly from that of many&mdash;of,
indeed, the greater number&mdash;of our citizens
of German birth or ancestry. Until America
became directly concerned it was perfectly explicable
that they should sympathize with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
people, if not with the government, of the German
Empire. The <i>Lusitania</i> tragedy, defended
in many cases openly by German sympathizers;
the disclosure of the duplicity of the German
ambassador, and revelations of the insidious
activity and ingenious propaganda that had been
in progress under the guise of pacifism&mdash;all
condoned by great numbers of German-Americans&mdash;brought
us to a realization of the fact
that even unto the third and fourth generation
the fatherland still exercised its spell upon those
we had accepted unquestioningly as fellow citizens.
And yet, viewed in the retrospect, the
phenomenon is not so remarkable. More than
any other people who have enjoyed free access
to the &#8220;unguarded gates,&#8221; of which Aldrich
complained many years ago, the Germans have
settled themselves in both town and country in
colonies. Intermarriage has been very general
among them, and their social fife has been circumscribed
by ancestral tastes and preferences.
As they prospered they made frequent visits
to Germany, strengthening ties never wholly
broken.</p>

<p>It was borne in upon us in the months following
close upon the declaration of war against
Germany, that many citizens of German birth,
long enjoying the freedom and the opportunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
of the Valley of Democracy, had not really been
incorporated into the body of American citizenship,
but were still, in varying degrees, loyal to
the German autocracy. That in States we had
proudly pointed to as typically American there
should be open disloyalty or only a surly acceptance
of the American Government&#8217;s position
with reference to a hostile foreign Power was
profoundly disturbing. That amid the perils
of war Americanism should become the issue in
a political campaign, as in Wisconsin last April,
brought us face to face with the problem of a
more thorough assimilation of those we have
welcomed from the Old World&mdash;a problem
which when the urgent business of winning the
war has been disposed of, we shall not neglect
if we are wise. Wisconsin nobly asserted her
loyalty, and it should be noted further that her
response in enlistments, in loan subscriptions, in
contributions to the Red Cross and other war
benevolences have been commensurate with her
wealth and in keeping with her honorable record
as one of the sturdiest of American commonwealths.
The rest of America should know that
as soon as Wisconsin realized that she had a problem
with reference to pro-Germanism, disguised
or open, her greatly preponderating number of
loyal citizens at once set to work to deal with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
situation. It was met promptly and aggressively,
and in the wide-spread campaign of
education the University of Wisconsin took an
important part. A series of pamphlets, straight-forward
and unequivocal, written by members
of the faculty and published by the State,
set forth very clearly America&#8217;s position and
the menace to civilization of Germany&#8217;s programme
of frightfulness.</p>

<p>Governor Philipp, in a patriotic address at
Sheboygan in May, on the seventieth anniversary
of Wisconsin&#8217;s admission to the Union,
after reviewing the State&#8217;s war preparations,
evoked great applause by these utterances:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a great deal said by some people
about peace. Don&#8217;t you permit yourselves to
be led astray by men who come to you with
some form of peace that they advocate that
would be an everlasting disgrace to the American
people. We cannot subscribe to any peace
treaty, my friends, that does not include
within its provisions an absolute and complete
annihilation of the military autocracy that we
have said to the world we are going to destroy.
We have enlisted our soldiers with that understanding.
We have asked our boys to go to
France to do that, and if we quit short of fulfilling
that contract with our own soldiers, those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
boys on the battlefield will have given their
lives in vain.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the present state of feeling it is impossible
to weigh from available data the question of
how far there was some sort of &#8220;understanding&#8221;
between the government at Berlin and persons
of German sympathies in the United States
that when <i>Der Tag</i> dawned for the precipitation
of the great scheme of world domination
they would stand ready to assist by various
processes of resistance and interference. For
the many German-Americans who stood steadfastly
for the American cause at all times it is
unfortunate that much testimony points to
some such arrangement. At this time it is
difficult to be just about this, and it is far from
my purpose to support an indictment that is
an affront to the intelligence and honor of the
many for the offenses of scattered groups and
individuals; and yet through fifty years German
organizations, a German-language press,
the teaching of German in public schools fostered
the German spirit, and the efforts made to
preserve the solidarity of the German people
lend color to the charge. It cannot be denied
that systematic German propaganda, either
open or in pacifist guise, was at work energetically
throughout the West from the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
of the war to arouse sentiment against
American resistance to German encroachments.</p>

<p>Americans of German birth have been controlled
very largely by leaders, often men of
wealth, who directed them in their affairs great
and small. This &#8220;system&#8221; took root in times
when the immigrant, finding himself in a strange
land and unfamiliar with its language, naturally
sought counsel of his fellow countrymen who
had already learned the ways of America.
This form of leadership has established a curious
habit of dependence, and makes against freedom
of thought and action in the humble while
augmenting the power of the strong. It has
been a common thing for German parents to encourage
in their children the idea of German
superiority and Germany&#8217;s destiny to rule the
world. A gentleman whose parents, born in
Germany, came to the Middle West fifty years
ago told me recently that his father, who
left Germany to escape military service, had
sought to inculcate these ideas in the minds of
his children from their earliest youth. The
sneer at American institutions has been very
common among Germans of this type. Another
young man of German ancestry complained
bitterly of this contemptuous attitude toward
things American. There was, he said, a group<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
of men who met constantly in a German clubhouse
to belittle America and exalt the joys of
the fatherland. Their attitude toward their
adopted country was condensed into an oft-repeated
formula: &#8220;What shall we think of a
people whose language does not contain an
equivalent for <i>Gem&uuml;tlichkeit</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>As part of the year&#8217;s record I may speak
from direct knowledge of a situation with which
we were brought face to face in Indianapolis,
a city of three hundred thousand people, in a
State in which the centre of population for the
United States has been fixed by the federal
census for two decades. Indiana&#8217;s capital, we
like to believe, is a typical American city.
Here the two tides of migration from the East
and the Southeast met in the first settlement.
A majestic shaft in the heart of the town testifies
to the participation of Indiana in all the
American wars from the Revolution; in no
other State perhaps is political activity so vigorous
as here. It would seem that if there exists
anywhere a healthy American spirit it might be
sought here with confidence. The phrase &#8220;He&#8217;s
an honest German&#8221; nowhere conveyed a deeper
sense of rectitude and probity. Men of German
birth or ancestry have repeatedly held
responsible municipal and county offices. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
yet this city affords a striking instance of the
deleterious effect of the preservation of the race
group. It must be said that the community&#8217;s
spirit toward these citizens was the friendliest
in the world; that in the first years of the
European War allowances were generously made
for family ties that still bound many to the
fatherland and for pride and prejudice of race.
There had never been any question as to the
thorough assimilation of the greater number
into the body of American democracy until the
beginning of the war in 1914.</p>

<p>When America joined with the Allies a silence
fell upon those who had been supporting the
German cause. The most outspoken of the
German sympathizers yielded what in many
cases was a grudging and reluctant assent
to America&#8217;s preparations for war. Others
made no sign one way or the other. There
were those who wished to quibble&mdash;who said
that they were for America, of course, but that
they were not for England; that England had
begun the war to crush Germany; that the
stories of atrocities were untrue. As to the
<i>Lusitania</i>, Americans had no business to disregard
the warning of the Imperial German
Government; and America &#8220;had no right&#8221;
to ship munitions to Germany&#8217;s enemies. Reports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
of disloyal speech or of active sedition on
the part of well-known citizens were freely
circulated.</p>

<p>German influence in the public schools had
been marked for years, and the president of the
school board was a German, active in the
affairs of the National German-American Alliance.
The teaching of German in the grade
schools was forbidden by the Indianapolis
school commissioners last year, though it is
compulsory under a State law where the parents
of twenty-five children request it. It was
learned that &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; was
sung in German in at least one public school as
part of the instruction in the German language,
and this was defended by German-Americans
on the ground that knowledge of their national
anthem in two languages broadened the children&#8217;s
appreciation of its beauties. One might
wonder just how long the singing of &#8220;Die
Wacht am Rhein&#8221; in a foreign language would
be tolerated in Germany!</p>

<p>We witnessed what in many cases was a
gradual and not too hearty yielding to the
American position, and what in others was a
refusal to discuss the matter with a protest
that any question of loyalty was an insult.
Suggestions that a public demonstration by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
German-Americans, at a time when loyalty
meetings were being held by American citizens
everywhere, would satisfy public clamor and
protect innocent sufferers from business boycott
and other manifestations of disapproval
were met with indignation. The situation became
acute upon the disclosure that the Independent
Turnverein, a club with a handsome
house that enrolled many Americans in its membership,
had on New Year&#8217;s Eve violated the
government food regulations. The president,
who had been outspoken against Germany
long before America was drawn into the war,
made public apology, and as a result of the flurry
steps were taken immediately to change the
name of the organization to the Independent
Athletic Club. On Lincoln&#8217;s Birthday a patriotic
celebration was held in the club. On
Washington&#8217;s Birthday <i>Das Deutsche Haus</i>, the
most important German social centre in the
State, announced a change of its name to the
Athen&aelig;um. In his address on this occasion Mr.
Carl H. Lieber said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With mighty resolve we have taken up arms to gain
recognition for the lofty principles of a free people in unalterable
opposition to autocracy and military despotism.
Emerging from the mists and smoke of battle, these American
principles, like brilliant handwriting in the skies, have
been clearly set out by our President for the eyes of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
world to see. Our country stands undivided for their
realization. Impartially and unselfishly we are fighting,
we feel, for justice in this world and the rights of mankind.</p>
</div>

<p>This from a representative citizen of the second
generation satisfactorily disposed of the question
of loyalty, both as to the renamed organization
and the majority of its more influential members.
A little later the M&auml;nnerchor, another German
club, changed its name to the Academy of
Music.</p>

<p>It is only just to say that, as against many
evidences of a failure to assimilate, there is
gratifying testimony that a very considerable
number of persons of German birth or ancestry
in these States have neither encouraged nor
have they been affected by attempts to diffuse
and perpetuate German ideas. Many German
families&mdash;I know conspicuous instances in
Western cities&mdash;are in no way distinguishable
from their neighbors of American stock.
In one Middle Western city a German mechanic,
who before coming to America served in the
German army and is without any illusions as to
the delights of autocracy, tells me that attachment
to the fatherland is confined very largely
to the more prosperous element, and that he
encountered little hostility among the humbler
people of German antecedents whom he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
attempted to convince of the justice of the
American position.</p>

<p>The National German-American Alliance,
chartered by special act of Congress in 1901,
was one of the most insidious and mischievous
agencies for German propaganda in America.
It was a device for correlating German societies
of every character&mdash;turnvereins, music societies,
church organizations, and social clubs, and it
is said that the Alliance had 2,500,000 members
scattered through forty-seven American States.
&#8220;Our own prestige,&#8221; recites one of its publications,
&#8220;depends upon the prestige of the fatherland,
and for that reason we cannot allow any
disparagement of Germany to go unpunished.&#8221;
It was recited in the Alliance&#8217;s statement of its
aims that one of its purposes was to combat
&#8220;nativistic encroachments.&#8221; I am assured by
a German-American that this use of &#8220;nativistic&#8221;
does not refer to the sense in which it was
used in America in the Know-Nothing period,
but that it means merely resistance to puritanical
infringements upon personal freedom,
with special reference to prohibition.</p>

<p>The compulsory teaching of German in the
public schools was a frank item of the Alliance&#8217;s
programme. In his book, &#8220;Their True Faith
and Allegiance&#8221; (1916), Mr. Gustavus Ohlinger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
of Toledo, whose testimony before the Judiciary
Committee of the United States Senate attracted
much attention last February, describes
the systematic effort to widen the sphere of the
teaching of German in Western States. Ohio
and Indiana have laws requiring German to be
taught upon the petition of parents. Before
the repeal of a similar law in Nebraska last
April we find that in Nebraska City the school
board had been compelled by the courts to
obey the law, though less than one-third of the
petitioners really intended to have their children
receive instruction in German. Mr. Ohlinger
thus describes the operation of the law in
Omaha:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the city of Omaha ... the State organizer of the
Nebraska federation of German societies visited the
schools recently and was more than pleased with what
he found: the children were acquiring a typically Berlin
accent, sung a number of German songs to his entire
approval, and finally ended by rendering &#8220;Die Wacht
am Rhein&#8221; with an enthusiasm and a gusto which could
not be excelled among children of the fatherland. Four
years ago Nebraska had only 90 high schools which offered
instruction in German. To-day, so the Alliance reports,
German is taught in 222 high schools and in the grade
schools of nine cities. Omaha alone has 3,500 pupils
taking German instruction. In addition to this, the
State federation has been successful in obtaining an appropriation
for the purchase of German books for the
State circulating library. Germans have been urged to
call for such books, in order to convince the State librarian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
that there is a popular demand and to induce further
progress in this direction.</p>
</div>

<p>These conditions have, of course, passed, and
it is for those of us who would guard jealously
our rights, and honestly fulfil our obligations,
as American citizens to see to it that they do
not recur. The Alliance announced its voluntary
dissolution some time before its charter
was annulled, but the testimony before the King
committee, which the government has published,
will be an important source of material for the
historian of the war. German propaganda and
activity in the Middle West did little for the
Kaiser but to make the word &#8220;German&#8221; an
odious term. &#8220;German&#8221; in business titles and
in club names has disappeared and German
language newspapers have in many instances
changed their names or gone out of business.
I question whether the end of the war will witness
any manifestations of magnanimity that
will make possible a restoration of the teaching
of German in primary and high schools.</p>

<p>We of the Middle West, who had thought
ourselves the especial guardians of American
democracy, found with dismay that the mailed
fist of Berlin was clutching our public schools.
In Chicago, where so much time, money, and
thought are expended in the attempt to Americanize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the foreign accretions, the spelling-book
used in the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and
eighth grades consisted wholly of word-lists,
with the exception of two exercises&mdash;one of
ten lines, describing the aptness of the natives
of Central Australia in identifying the tracks of
birds and animals, and another which is here
reproduced:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">THE KAISER IN THE MAKING</p>

<p>In the <i>gymnasium</i> at Cassel the German <i>Kaiser</i> spent
three years of his boyhood, a <i>diligent</i> but not a <i>brilliant</i>
pupil, ranking tenth among <i>seventeen candidates</i> for the
<i>university</i>.</p>

<p>Many tales are told of this <i>period</i> of his life, and one
of them, at least, is <i>illuminating</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>professor</i>, it is said, wishing to curry favor with his
royal pupil, informed him <i>overnight</i> of the chapter in Greek
that was to be made the <i>subject</i> of the next day&#8217;s lesson.</p>

<p>The young <i>prince</i> did what many boys would not have
done. As soon as the classroom was <i>opened</i> on the following
morning, he entered and wrote <i>conspicuously</i> on
the blackboard the <i>information</i> that had been given him.</p>

<p>One may say <i>unhesitatingly</i> that a boy capable of such
an action has the root of a fine <i>character</i> in him, <i>possesses</i>
that <i>chivalrous</i> sense of fair play which is the nearest thing
to a <i>religion</i> that may be looked for at that age, hates
<i>meanness</i> and <i>favoritism</i>, and will, <i>wherever possible</i>, expose
them. There is in him a <i>fundamental</i> bent toward
what is clean, manly, and aboveboard.</p>
</div>

<p>The copy of the book before me bears the imprint,
&#8220;Board of Education, City of Chicago,
1914.&#8221; The Kaiser&#8217;s &#8220;chivalrous sense of fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
play&#8221; has, of course, ceased to be a matter of
public instruction in the Western metropolis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Im Vaterland,&#8221; a German reading-book
used in a number of Western schools, states
frankly in its preface that it was &#8220;made in Germany,&#8221;
and that &#8220;after the manuscript had
been completed it was manifolded and copies
were criticised by teachers in Prussia, Saxony,
and Bavaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>In contrast with the equivocal loyalty of
Germans who have sought to perpetuate and
accentuate the hyphen, it is a pleasure to testify
to the admirable spirit with which the Jewish
people in these Western States have repeatedly
manifested their devotion to America.
Many of these are of German birth or the children
of German immigrants, and yet I am aware
of no instance of a German Jew in the region
most familiar to me who has not warmly supported
the American cause. They have not
only given generously to the Red Cross and to
funds for French and Belgian relief, quite independently
of their efforts in behalf of people of
their own race in other countries, but they have
rendered most important aid in all other branches
of war activities. No finer declaration of whole-hearted
Americanism has been made by any
American of German birth than that expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
(significantly at Milwaukee) by Mr. Otto H.
Kahn, of New York, last January:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Until the outbreak of the war, in 1914, I maintained
close and active personal and business relations in Germany.
I was well acquainted with a number of the leading
personages of the country. I served in the German
army thirty years ago. I took an active interest in furthering
German art in America. I do not apologize for,
nor am I ashamed of, my German birth. But I am
ashamed&mdash;bitterly and grievously ashamed&mdash;of the
Germany which stands convicted before the high tribunal
of the world&#8217;s public opinion of having planned and
willed war, of the revolting deeds committed in Belgium
and northern France, of the infamy of the <i>Lusitania</i> murders,
of innumerable violations of The Hague conventions
and the law of nations, of abominable and perfidious plotting
in friendly countries, and shameless abuse of their
hospitality, of crime heaped upon crime in hideous defiance
of the laws of God and man.</p>
</div>

<p>A curious phase of this whole situation is the
fact that so many thousands of Germans who
found the conditions in their own empire intolerable
and sought homes in America, should
have fostered a sentimental attachment for the
fatherland as a land of comfort and happiness,
and of its ruler as a glorious Lohengrin afloat
upon the river of time in a swan-boat, in an
atmosphere of charm and mystery, to the
accompaniment of enchanting music. In their
clubs and homes they so dreamed of this Germany
and talked of it in the language of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
land of their illusion that the sudden transformation
of their knight of the swan-boat into
a war lord of frightfulness and terror, seeking
to plant his iron feet upon an outraged world,
has only slowly penetrated to their comprehension.
It is clear that there has been on
America&#8217;s part a failure, that cannot be minimized
or scouted, to communicate to many of
the most intelligent and desirable of all our
adopted citizens, the spirit of that America
founded by Washington and saved by Lincoln,
and all the great host who in their train&mdash;</p>

<p>In closing these papers it seems ungenerous
to ignore the criticisms with which they were
favored during their serial publication. To a
gentleman in Colorado who insists that my
definition and use of Folks and &#8220;folksiness&#8221;
leave him in the dark as to my meaning, I can
only suggest that a visit to certain communities
which I shall be glad to choose for him, in the
States of our central basin, will do much for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
illumination. An intimation from another
quarter that those terms as I have employed
them originated in Kentucky does not distress
me a particle, for are not we of Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois first cousins of the people across the
Ohio? At once some one will rise to declare
that all that is truly noble in the Middle West
was derived from the Eastern States or from
New England, and on this question I might with
a good conscience write a fair brief on either side.
With one Revolutionary great-grandfather, a
native of Delaware, buried in Ohio, and another,
a Carolinian, reposing in the soil of Kentucky,
I should be content no matter where fell the
judgment of the court.</p>

<p>To the complaint of the Chicago lady who
assailed the editor for his provincialism in permitting
an Easterner to abuse her city, I demur
that I was born and have spent most of
the years of my life within a few hours of Chicago,
a city dear to me from long and rather
intimate acquaintance and hallowed by most
agreeable associations. The <i>Evening Post</i> of
Chicago, having found the fruits of my note-book
&#8220;dull&#8221; as to that metropolis, must permit
me to plead that in these stirring times
the significant things about a city are not its
clubs, its cabarets, or its galloping &#8220;loop-hounds,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
but the efforts of serious-minded
citizens of courage and vision to make it a
better place to live in. The cynicism of those
to whom the contemplation of such efforts is
fatiguing, lacks novelty and is only tolerable in
so far as it is a stimulus to the faithful workers
in the vineyard.</p>

<p>I have spoken of The Valley of Democracy
as being in itself a romance, and the tale as
written upon hill and plain and along lake and
river is well-nigh unequalled for variety and interest
in the annals of mankind. I must plead
that the sketchiness of these papers is due not
to any lack of respect for the work of soberer
chroniclers, but is attributable rather to the
humility with which I have traversed a region
laboriously explored by the gallant company
of scholars who have established Middle Western
history upon so firm a foundation. It is
the view of persons whose opinions are entitled
to all respect that the winning of the West is
the most significant and important phase of
American history. Certain it is that the story
wherever one dips into it immediately quickens
the heart-beat, and it is a pleasure to note the
devotion and intelligence with which materials
for history have been assembled in all the States
embraced in my general title.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>The great pioneer collector of historical material
was Dr. Reuben Gold Thwaites, who
made the Wisconsin Historical Society the most
efficient local organization of its kind in the
country. &#8220;He was the first,&#8221; writes Dr. Clarence
W. Alvord, of the University of Illinois,
&#8220;to unite the State historical agent and the
university department of history so that they
give each other mutual assistance&mdash;a union
which some States have brought about only
lately with great difficulty, while others are still
limping along on two ill-mated crutches.&#8221; Dr.
Thwaites was an indefatigable laborer in his
chosen field, and an inspiring leader. He not
only brought to light a prodigious amount of
material and made it accessible to other scholars,
but he communicated his enthusiasm to a noteworthy
school of historians who have specialized
in &#8220;sections&#8221; of the broad fertile field into
which he set the first plough. Where the land
is so new it is surprising and not a little amusing
that there should be debatable points of
history, and yet the existence of these adds
zest to the labors of the younger school of historical
students and writers. State historical
societies have in recent years assumed a new
dignity and importance, due in great measure
to the fine example set by Wisconsin under
Dr. Thwaites&#8217;s guidance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>Frederick Jackson Turner is another historian
whose interest in the West has borne fruit in
works of value, and he has established new
points of orientation for explorers in this field.
He must always be remembered as one of the
first to appreciate the significance of the Western
frontier in American history, and by his
writings and addresses he has done much to
arouse respect for the branch in which he has
specialized. Nor shall I omit Dr. John H.
Finley&#8217;s &#8220;The French in the Heart of America&#8221;
as among recent valuable additions to historical
literature. There is a charming freshness and
an infectious enthusiasm in Dr. Finley&#8217;s pages,
attributable to his deep poetic feeling for the
soil to which he was born. All writers of the
history of the Northwest, of course, confess their
indebtedness to Parkman, and it should not be
forgotten that before Theodore Roosevelt became
a distinguished figure in American public
life he had written &#8220;The Winning of the West,&#8221;
which established a place for him among American
historians.</p>

<p>A historical society was formed in Indiana in
1830, but as no building was ever provided for
its collection, many valuable records were lost
when the State capitol was torn down thirty
years ago. Many documents that should have
been kept within the State found their way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Wisconsin&mdash;an appropriation by the tireless
Thwaites of which Indiana can hardly complain
in view of the fact that she has never provided
for the proper housing of historical material.
Still, interest in local history, much of it having
an important bearing on the national life, has
never wholly died, and in recent years the
<i>Indiana Historical Magazine</i> and the labors of
Jacob P. Dunn, James A. Woodburn, Logan
Esarey, Daniel Waite Howe, Harlow Lindley,
and other students and writers have directed
attention to the richness of the local field.</p>

<p>Illinois, slipping this year into her second century
of statehood, is thoroughly awake to the
significance of the Illinois country in Western
development. Dr. Alvord, who, by his researches
and writings, has illuminated many
dark passages of Middle Western history, has
taken advantage of the centenary to rouse the
State to a new sense of its important share in
American development. The investigator in
this field is rewarded by the unearthing of
treasures as satisfying as any that may fall
to the hand of a Greek arch&aelig;ologist. The
trustees of the Illinois Historical Library sent
Dr. Alvord to &#8220;sherlock&#8221; an old French document
reported to be in the court-house of
St. Clair county. Not only was this document<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
found but the more important Cahokia papers
were discovered, bearing upon the history of the
Illinois country during the British occupation
and the American Revolution. Illinois has undertaken
a systematic survey of county archives,
which includes also a report upon manuscript
material held by individuals, and the centenary
is to have a fitting memorial in a five-volume
State history to be produced by authoritative
writers.</p>

<p>Iowa, jealous of her history and traditions,
has a State-supported historical society with a
fine list of publications to its credit. Under the
direction of the society&#8217;s superintendent, Dr.
Benjamin F. Shambaugh, the search for material
is thorough and persistent, and over
forty volumes of historical material have been
published. The Iowa public and college libraries
are all branches of the society and depositories
of its publications. The Mississippi Valley
Historical Association held its eleventh
annual meeting this year in St. Paul to mark the
dedication of the new building erected by the
State for the use of the Minnesota Historical
Society.</p>

<p>The wide scope of Western historical inquiry
is indicated in the papers of the Mississippi Valley
Association, and its admirable quarterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
review, in which we find monographs by the
ethnologist, the specialist in exploration, and
the student of political crises, such as the
Lincoln-Douglas contest and the Greenback
movement. Not only are the older Middle
Western States producing historical matter of
national importance but Montana and the
Dakotas are inserting chapters that bind the
Mississippi Valley to the picturesque annals of
California in a continuous narrative. Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Illinois, and
Indiana have established an informal union
for the prosecution of their work, one feature
of which is the preparation of a &#8220;finding list&#8221;
of documents in Washington. This co-ordination
prevents duplication of labor and makes
for unity of effort in a field of common interest.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>I had hoped that space would permit a review
in some detail of municipal government in a
number of cities, but I may now emphasize
only the weakness of a mere &#8220;form,&#8221; or &#8220;system,&#8221;
where the electorate manifest too great a
confidence in a device without the &#8220;follow-up&#8221;
so essential to its satisfactory employment;
and I shall mention Omaha, whose municipal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
struggle has been less advertised than that of
some other Western cities. Omaha was fortunate
in having numbered among its pioneers a
group of men of unusual ability and foresight.
First a military outpost and a trading centre
for adventurous settlements, the building of the
Union Pacific made it an important link between
East and West, and, from being a market for
agricultural products of one of the most fertile
regions in the world, its interests have multiplied
until it now offers a most interesting study
in the interdependence and correlation of economic
factors.</p>

<p>Like most other Western cities, Omaha grew
so rapidly and was so preoccupied with business
that its citizens, save for the group of the faithful
who are to be found everywhere, left the matter
of local government to the politicians. Bossism
became intolerable, and with high hopes the
people in 1912 adopted commission government;
but the bosses, with their usual adaptability
and resourcefulness, immediately captured the
newly created offices. It is a fair consensus of
local opinion that there has been little if any
gain in economy or efficiency. Under the old
charter city councilmen were paid $1,800; the
commissioners under the new plan receive $4,500,
with an extra $500 for the one chosen mayor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Several of the commissioners are equal to their
responsibilities, but a citizen who is a close
student of such matters says that &#8220;while in
theory we were to get a much higher grade of
public servants, in fact we merely elected men
content to work for the lower salary and doubled
and tripled their pay. We still have $1,800 men
in $4,500 jobs.&#8221; However, at the election last
spring only one of the city commissioners was
re-elected, and Omaha is hoping that the present
year will show a distinct improvement in the
management of its public business. Local pride
is very strong in these Western cities, and from
the marked anxiety to show a forward-looking
spirit and a praiseworthy sensitiveness to criticism
we may look confidently for a steady gain
in the field of municipal government.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that in the general awakening
to our imperfections caused by the war, there
may be a widening of these groups of patient,
earnest citizens, who labor for the rationalization
of municipal government. The disposition
to say that &#8220;as things have been they remain&#8221;
is strong upon us, but it is worth remembering
that Clough also bids us &#8220;say not the struggle
naught availeth.&#8221; The struggle goes on courageously,
and the number of those who concern
themselves with the business of strengthening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
the national structure by pulling out the rotten
timbers in our cities proceeds tirelessly.</p>

<p>Western cities are constantly advertising
their advantages and resources, and offering
free sites and other inducements to manufacturers
to tempt them to move; but it occurs
to me that forward-looking cities may present
their advantages more alluringly by perfecting
their local government and making this the
burden of their appeal. We shall get nowhere
with commission government or the city-manager
plan until cities realize that no matter
how attractive and plausible a device, it is worthless
unless due consideration is given to the
human equation. It is very difficult to find
qualified administrators under the city-manager
plan. A successful business man or even a
trained engineer may fail utterly, and we seem
to be at the point of creating a new profession
of great opportunities for young men (and
women too) in the field of municipal administration.
At the University of Kansas and perhaps
elsewhere courses are offered for the training of
city managers. The mere teaching of municipal
finance and engineering will not suffice; the
courses should cover social questions and kindred
matters and not neglect the psychology involved
in the matter of dealing fairly and justly with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
the public. By giving professional dignity to
positions long conferred upon the incompetent
and venal we should at least destroy the cynical
criticism that there are no men available for
the positions created; and it is conceivable
that once the idea of fitness has become implanted
in a careless and indifferent public a
higher standard will be set for all elective offices.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>No Easterner possessed of the slightest delicacy
will read what follows, which is merely a
memorandum for my friends and neighbors of
the great Valley. We of the West have never
taken kindly to criticism, chiefly because it has
usually been offered in a spirit of condescension,
or what in our extreme sensitiveness we have
been rather eager to believe to be such. In our
comfortable towns and villages we may admit
weaknesses the mention of which by our cousins
<i>in partibus infidelium</i> arouses our deepest ire.
We shall not meekly suffer the East in its disdainful
moods to play upon us with the light
lash of its irony; but among ourselves we may
confess that at times we have profited by Eastern
criticism. After all, there is no spirit of
the West that is very different from the spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
of the East. Though I only whisper it, we
have, I think, rather more humor. We are
friendlier, less snobbish, more sanguine in our
outlook upon public matters, and have a greater
confidence in democracy than the East. I have
indicated with the best heart in the world certain
phases and tendencies of our provinces that
seem to me admirable, and others beside which
I have scratched a question-mark for the contemplation
of the sober-minded. I am disposed
to say that the most interesting thing about us
is our politics, but that, safely though we have
ridden the tempest now and again, these be
times when it becomes us to ponder with a new
gravity the weight we carry in the national scale.
Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan,
Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin
wield 145 votes of the total of 531 in the
electoral college; and in 1916 Mr. Wilson&#8217;s
majority was only 23. The political judgment
of the nation is likely, far into the future, to be
governed by the West. We dare not, if we
would, carry our responsibilities lightly. We
have of late been taking our politics much more
seriously; a flexibility of the vote, apparent in
recent contests, is highly encouraging to those
of us who see a hope and a safety in the multiplication
of the independents. But even with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
this we have done little to standardize public
service; the ablest men of the West do not
govern it, and the fact that this has frequently
been true of the country at large can afford
us no honest consolation. There is no reason
why, if we are the intelligent, proud sons of
democracy we imagine ourselves to be, we
should not so elevate our political standards as
to put other divisions of the republic to shame.
There are thousands of us who at every election
vote for candidates we know nothing about, or
for others we would not think of intrusting with
any private affair, and yet because we find
their names under a certain party emblem we
cheerfully turn over to such persons important
public business for the honest and efficient
transaction of which they have not the slightest
qualification. What I am saying is merely a
repetition of what has been said for years without
marked effect upon the electorate. But
just now, when democracy is fighting for its life
in the world, we do well to give serious heed to
such warnings. If we have not time or patience
to perform the services required of a citizen who
would be truly self-governing, then the glory of
fighting for free institutions on the battle-fields
of Europe is enormously diminished.</p>

<p>The coming of the war found the West rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
hard put for any great cause upon which to
expend its energy and enthusiasm. We need
a good deal of enthusiasm to keep us &#8220;up to
pitch,&#8221; and I shall not scruple to say that, in
spite of our fine showing as to every demand
thus far made by the war, the roll of the drums
really found us inviting the reproach passed by
the prophet upon them &#8220;that lie upon beds of
ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches,
and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves
out of the midst of the stall.&#8221; Over and over
again, as I have travelled through the West
in recent years, it has occurred to me that
sorely indeed we needed an awakening. Self-satisfaction
and self-contemplation are little
calculated to promote that clear thinking and
vigorous initiative that are essential to triumphant
democracy. Yes; this may be just as true
of East or South; but it is of the West that we
are speaking. I shall go the length of saying
that any failure of democracy &#8220;to work&#8221; here
in America is more heavily chargeable upon us
of these Middle Western States than upon our
fellow Americans in other sections. For here
we are young enough to be very conscious of all
those processes by which States are formed
and political and social order established. Our
fathers or our grandfathers were pioneers; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
from them the tradition is fresh of the toil
and aspiration that went to the making of these
commonwealths. We cannot deceive ourselves
into believing that they did all that was necessary
to perpetuate the structure, and that it is
not incumbent upon us to defend, strengthen,
and renew what they fashioned. We had, like
many of those who have come to us from over
the sea to share in our blessings, fallen into the
error of assuming that America is a huge corporation
in which every one participates in the
dividends without reference to his part in earning
them. Politically speaking, we have too
great a number of those who &#8220;hang on behind&#8221;
and are a dead weight upon those who bear the
yoke. We must do better about this; and in
no way can the West prove its fitness to wield
power in the nation than through a quickening
of all those forces that tend to make popular
government an intelligently directed implement
controlled by the fit, and not a weapon caught
up and exercised ignorantly by the unfit.</p>

<p>Again, still speaking as one Westerner to another,
our entrance into the war found us dangerously
close to the point of losing something that
was finely spiritual in our forebears. I am
aware that an impatient shrug greets this
suggestion. The spires and towers of innumerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
churches decorate the Western sky-line, and
I accept them for what they represent, without
discussing the efficiency of the modern church
or its failure or success in meeting the problems
of modern life. There was apparent in the first
settlers of the Mississippi valley a rugged spirituality
that accounted for much in their achievements.
The West was a lonesome place and religion&mdash;Catholic
and Protestant&mdash;filled a need
and assisted greatly in making wilderness and
plain tolerable. The imagination of the pioneer
was quickened and brightened by the
promise of things that he believed to be eternal;
the vast sweep of prairie and woodland deepened
his sense of reliance upon the Infinite.
This sense so happily interpreted and fittingly
expressed by Lincoln is no longer discernible&mdash;at
least it is not obtrusively manifest&mdash;and
this seems to me a lamentable loss. Here,
again, it may be said that this is not peculiar
to the West; that we have only been affected
by the eternal movement of the time spirit.
And yet this elementary confidence in things
of the spirit played an important part in the
planting of the democratic ideal in the heart of
America, and we can but deplore the passing of
what to our immediate ancestors was so satisfying
and stimulating. And here, as with other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
problems that I have passed with only the most
superficial note, I have no solution, if indeed
any be possible. I am fully conscious that I
fumble for something intangible and elusive;
and it may be that I am only crying vainly for
the restoration of something that has gone forever.
Perhaps this war came opportunely to
break our precipitate rush toward materialism,
and the thing we were apparently losing, the
old enthusiasm for higher things, the greater
leisure for self-examination and self-communion,
may come again in the day of peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is always,&#8221; says Woodberry, &#8220;an
ideality of the human spirit&#8221; visible in all the
works of democracy, and we need to be reminded
of this frequently, for here in the
heart of America it is of grave importance that
we remain open-minded and open-hearted to
that continuing idealism which must be the
strength and stay of the nation.</p>

<p>Culture, as we commonly use the term,
may properly be allowed to pass as merely another
aspect of the idealism &#8220;deep in the general
heart of man&#8221; that we should like to believe to
be one of the great assets of the West. Still
addressing the Folks, my neighbors, I will
temerariously repeat an admission tucked into
an earlier chapter, that here is a field where we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
do well to carry ourselves modestly. There was
an impression common in my youth that culture
of the highest order was not only possible
in the West but that we Westerners were peculiarly
accessible to its benignant influences
and very likely to become its special guardians
and apostles. Those were times when life was
less complex, when the spirituality stirred by
the Civil War was still very perceptible, when
our enthusiasms were less insistently presented
in statistics of crops and manufactures. We
children of those times were encouraged to keep
Emerson close at hand, for his purifying and
elevating influence, and in a college town which
I remember very well the professor of Greek was
a venerated person and took precedence in any
company over the athletic director.</p>

<p>In those days, that seem now so remote, it
was quite respectable to speak of the humanities,
and people did so without self-consciousness.
But culture, the culture of the humanities,
never gained that foothold in the West that had
been predicted for it. That there are few signs
of its permanent establishment anywhere does
not conceal our failure either to implant it
or to find for it any very worthy substitute.
We have valiantly invested millions of dollars
in education and other millions in art museums<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
and in libraries without any resulting diffusion
of what we used to be pleased to call culture.
We dismiss the whole business quite characteristically
by pointing with pride to handsome
buildings and generous endowments in much
the same spirit that we call attention to a new
automobile factory. There are always the few
who profit by these investments; but it is not
for the few that we design them; it is for the
illumination of the great mass that we spend
our treasure upon them. The doctrine of the
few is the old doctrine of &#8220;numbers&#8221; and &#8220;the
remnant,&#8221; and even at the cost of reconstructing
human nature we promised to show the world
that a great body of people in free American
States could be made sensitive and responsive
to beauty in all its forms. The humanities still
struggle manfully, but without making any
great headway against adverse currents. The
State universities offer an infinite variety of
courses in literature and the fine arts, and they
are served by capable and zealous instructors,
but with no resulting progress against the tide
of materialism. &#8220;Culture,&#8221; as a friend of mine
puts it, &#8220;is on the blink.&#8221; We hear reassuring
reports of the State technical schools where the
humanities receive a niggardly minimum of attention,
and these institutions demand our heartiest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
admiration for the splendid work they are
doing. But our development is lamentably one-sided;
we have merely groups of cultivated
people, just as older civilizations had them, not
the great communities animated by ideals of
nobility and beauty that we were promised.</p>

<p>In the many matters which we of the West
shall be obliged to consider with reference to
the nation and the rest of the world as soon as
<i>Kultur</i> and its insolent presumptions have been
disposed of, culture, in its ancient and honorable
sense, is quite likely to make a poor fight
for attention. And yet here are things, already
falling into neglect, which we shall do well to
scan once and yet again before parting company
with them forever. There are balances as between
materialism and idealism which it is desirable
to maintain if the fineness and vigor of
democracy and its higher inspirational values
are to be further developed. Our Middle Western
idealism has been expending itself in channels
of social and political betterment, and it
remains to be seen whether we shall be able to
divert some part of its energy to the history,
the literature, and the art of the past, not for
cultural reasons merely but as part of our combat
with provincialism and the creation of a
broad and informed American spirit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;Having in mind things true, things elevated,
things just, things pure, things amiable,
things of good report&mdash;having these in mind,
studying and loving these, is what saves States,&#8221;
wrote Matthew Arnold thirty years ago. In
the elaboration of a programme for the future of
America that shall not ignore what is here connoted
there is presented to the Middle West
abundant material for new enthusiasms and
endeavors, commensurate with its opportunities
and obligations not merely as the Valley of
Democracy but as the Valley of Decision.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
